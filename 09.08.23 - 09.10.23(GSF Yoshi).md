### [Yoshi's **Halcyon** Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzSfTECTfIQ&t=605s)
>平静的, 宁和的 = halcyon

Yoshi’s Island is one of my happy places, the go-to game I play whenever I’m having a bad day.

It brings me such **nostalgia** for my childhood, and that’s not even because I played it a lot as a kid – I never owned a Super Nintendo so the only got to play it was when visiting friends.
>怀旧的 = nostalgia

There’s just something about it that captures the childlike feelings of **innocence** and joy that I experienced at a young age, and I think a lot of that something has to do with the music.
>天真无邪 = innocence

From the very beginning, music was an important part of Yoshi’s identity.

His **grand debut** as Mario’s loyal **steed** was in 1990’s Super Mario World – He could **gobble up** enemies, gives Mario an extra shot at life, and helps him to safely make dangerous jumps.
>首次登场 = grand debut

>坐骑 = steed

>吞咽 = gobble up

Unlike some of Mario’s other power-ups though, there’s no dedicated musical theme when riding Yoshi, as at any point Mario might fall off and hop back on, interrupting the flow of music.

Instead, **an elegant solution was devised in** which a layer of **bongos** is added to the mix whenever Mario is dinoback.
>一个更优雅的解决方案是(被发明) = an elegant solution was devised in 

>小鼓 = bongo

This is called **dynamic layering**, or **vertical re-orchestration**, or **adaptive stemming**, or any combination of those words really.
>动态分层 = dynamic layering

>垂直重编排 = vertical re-orchestration

>自适应填充 = adaptive stemming

I’ve talked about it endlessly on this channel, but Yoshi was one of the very first uses of this technique, and definitely the most famous from this era.

So when Yoshi **was promoted** to main character for Super Mario World 2, **this idea was built upon**.
>被晋升 = be promoted

>这个想法得到了进一步发展 = this idea was built upon

As you make your way through the six areas of Yoshi’s Island, the map theme adds a new layer of instrumentation for every new world that you reach.

This provides you with a sense of progression as you help the Yoshi clan complete their **quest**.
>探索, 寻找 = quest

The island setting of the game easily **lent itself to** the **tropical vibe** established by the bongos in Super Mario World, and they do re-appear in the sequel.
>融入到 = lend itself to

>热带氛围 = tropical vibe(氛围)

Koji Kondo also took this opportunity to study African music and incorporated some of its rhythmic elements.

But there was also one other major influence for the soundtrack.

1994 saw the release of Donkey Kong Country, with its **3D pre-rendered graphics** **unrivalled** on the Super Nintendo.
>3D预渲染图形 = 3D pre-rendered(致使, 提出 = render) graphics

>无敌的 = unrivalled

“There wasn’t a single thing that was hand-drawn in that game” says Brendan Gunn, a lead programmer on DKC.

**Nintendo fancied this style and pressured the Yoshi’s Island team to adopt the technology**, but director Takashi Tezuka resisted, saying “Probably every game from here on out is going to look more like Donkey Kong Country... that being the case, we decided to go against the trend one last time and make something with a **heartwarming**, handmade style.”
>老任很喜欢这个风格, 并且压力耀西组让他们也采取这项技术 = Nintendo **fancied** this style and **pressured** the Yoshi's Island team to **adopt** the technology

The final art-style was completely hand-drawn and inspired by Yoshi’s job as **babysitter** to the **infant** Mario.
>幼儿保姆 = babysitter

>婴幼儿 = infant

The game looks like a child’s drawing, complete with bright **pastel** colours and crayon textures.
>蜡笔 = pastel

Lessons on the game’s mechanics are written on chalkboards too.

The game **is styled off** the life experience of a child, and the music too very obviously draws from this decision.
>是...的风格 = be styled off...

The opening prologue is presented as a bedtime story, set to a **lullaby** on a **wind-up music box**.
>摇篮曲 = lullaby

>发条八音盒 = wind-up music box

While this is the most obvious connection to the childish style, I feel that other tracks capture the memories of childhood in more subtle ways.

When you reach the end of a level, the Goal & Score music isn’t your standard victory fanfare, but sounds more similar to **circus or carnival music**.
>马戏团或狂欢节音乐 = circus or carnival music

It sounds like you just won a prize, **evoking** that child-like excitement over a small victory.
>唤起 = evoke(UT那集有这个词)

The mid-boss theme sounds inspired by **ballpark music**, perhaps reminiscent of a family outing to the baseball.
>棒球场音乐 = ballpark music

And this makes sense when you consider how Yoshi defeats his enemies: by throwing eggs at them like a baseball **pitcher**.
>投手 = pitcher

Kondo incorporates a wide range of influences to achieve an **overall** feeling of childhood, and the result is a cohesive soundtrack that also **traverses many genres**.
>整体上 = overall

>横贯很多类别 = traverse many genres

From African and tropical vibes, to lullabies, ragtime, and he even manages to **outdo** Nobuo Uematsu at his own game of rocking boss themes, with the most metal piece of music to ever come out of the Super Nintendo.
>超过 = outdo

Yeah, that’s in a Yoshi game.

This **assortment** of genres would become another important **staple** in the series going forward.
>各种物品的聚集物 = assortment

>主要产品, 主题 = staple

For Yoshi’s Story, composer Kazumi Totaka wrote one main theme for the game and transformed it into a different genre for every level.

Whether that’s some Revolver-esque psychedelica, a reggae track, or a **straight-up hip-hop banger**.
>《创世纪》风格的迷幻摇滚 = Revolver-esque psychedelica

>直球的嘻哈曲目 = straight-up hip-pop banger

*sigh* I miss the nineties.

This would **set the format for** the soundtracks of future Yoshi games – Yoshi’s Island DS and Yoshi’s New Island both have one main theme with **variations** on it for each level.
>为...奠定了基调 = set a format for...

>变奏 = variation

Story also built on the child aesthetic of Island, despite the absence of Baby Mario; though it’s less inspired by childhood, more just made for children.

This time it’s in the form of a ***pop-up book***, the game is super easy, and the music in true **Totaka fashion is cute and quirky**.
>手指木偶书 = pop-up book

>户高一生风格的, 可爱且古怪的曲子 = Totaka fashion is cute and quirky

The Yoshis also sing songs now, and this is perhaps Kazumi Totaka’s biggest contribution to the Yoshi sound: He gave Yoshi a voice.

In fact, his own voice.

Every (byum-bum!) and (brring-hah!) is Totaka himself, and he even re-recorded it all as recently as Super Mario Galaxy 2.

It also sounds like the singing could be an actual voice recording too, though it’s hard to tell.

Totaka imagines the Yoshis like a group of children all singing off-key, and this would lead to the most **infamous** sound in the series.
>声名狼藉的 = infamous

2014’s Yoshi’s New Island **takes all its cues from** the original Island and Story games.
>从...处吸取了所有灵感 = take all its cues from

From Island it obviously borrows the gameplay and art-style, but also reuses Koji Kondo’s lullaby, now sounding like it’s being played by a child on a **dulled toy xylophone**.
>需要调音(钝的)玩具木琴 = dulled toy xylophone

And it also copies the dynamic map progression idea too.

From Story it takes the theme variation for levels and the **chorus** of singing Yoshis, though perhaps not so successfully.
>合唱, 合唱班 = chorus

Rather than life-like voices, New Island uses a **cacophony** of annoying instruments: kazoos, a fat **brassy horn**, and **squeaky** toys.
>刺耳的, 不和谐的声音 = cacophony

>铜管 = brassy horn

>刺耳的 = squeaky

There’s zero harmony between the instruments and they all clash together on the same beats.

And instead of the simple, cute melodies in Story, New Island’s melodies are **obnoxious** and doubles down on the **dissonance** by emphasising the most uncomfortable notes.
>令人不愉快的 = obnoxious

>不和谐 = dissonance

If Yoshi’s Island was seemingly inspired by childhood and Story was made for kids, then New Island sounds composed and performed by children.

Perhaps a great idea on paper, but it doesn’t make for the most enjoyable of listening experiences.

But it’s not all **downhill** for Yoshi.
>下坡 = downhill

Tomoya Tomita responded with a great but ultimately very safe soundtrack to 2015’s Yoshi’s Woolly World.

However it doesn’t feel very much like Yoshi - the **yarn motif** that **is carried over from** Kirby’s Epic Yarn seemingly **overrides** the childhood theme, and the music is less Yoshi-sounding than ever before.
>纺织线主题 = yarn motif

>来自 = be carried over from

>盖过, 压过 = override(不管, 不顾)

With its **breezy** finger-picked guitars it has a slight country-western vibe.
>有微风的, 轻松的 = breezy

It actually reminds me of the **royalty-free music** you’d hear in the back of YouTube vlogs, though with every kid having their own YouTube channel nowadays, perhaps this actually is the new kid’s music.
>免版税音乐 = royalty-free music

There’s a new Yoshi game coming for the Nintendo Switch, which seems to return the series to the childhood style.

It has an arts and craft aesthetic similar to Yoshi’s Story, and the **trailer** music features a recorder, the one instrument every child learns to play in primary school.
>预告片 = trailer

It’s interesting to see how multiple composers have approached the same theme of childhood in different ways.

The soundtrack to Yoshi’s Island **resonates with me** the most because it tried to evoke not just a childish sound, but the memories and feelings associated with childhood.
>使我共鸣 = resonate(共鸣) with me

I love music boxes because I associate the sound with feelings of comfort, safety, and my favourite **pastime**, sleeping.
>娱乐, 消遣 = pastime(背过的新词)

I don’t know if Koji Kondo was actually inspired by trips to the carnival or baseball as a kid, but his music for Yoshi’s Island evokes in me those memories, whether he or I experienced them or not.

Good art draws from personal experience.

You can use anything in your own life to inspire your work and allow it to resonate with others.

No matter how seemingly normal or boring your life is, there is always a unique perspective that your experience in life gives you, that you are able to **infuse** with your work to make it different.
>灌注, 引入 = infuse

And for me, it took a game about multi-coloured dinosaurs seemingly made for children to realise that.

Thank you so much for watching.

I feel so **indebted** to my wonderful patrons, whose generous support is allowing me to continue making these videos into the new year.
>负债的, 感激的 = indebted

All patrons get early access to videos as well as exclusive channel updates, some get extra thoughts and things that were cut from the video, and top-tier supporters get their name shown on-screen, right now.

Special shout-out to all the brand new top-tier patrons who have backed me since the last video.
