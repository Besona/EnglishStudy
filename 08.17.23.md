Edit: Lots of great advice on here. I appreciate the reads and comments from everyone. About half gave some solid advice and even offered help/connections, about half sounded like they got burnt in sales and just being a debbie downer after looking at their previous posts. From about 3 days prior to the post until now, we've conducted about 10 interviews with solid candidates that are genuinely interested and have the skillset and background to succeed (with all our cards laid on the table - showing our track record, processes, products, margins, everything). Most of these came from Indeed - and one from here. I was pleasantly surprised. Not gonna lie - I was more on the fence of the debbie downer group myself - but I'm pretty optimistic at this point.
First post in this sub and will keep people in the loop if they are interested.
We need a great salesperson (who doesn't) to continue the growth, but we don't have a ton of cash to offer upfront. We want to find someone that would potentially be interested in equity as long as benchmarks are met, but that's not you're everyday post on indeed. The commission structure is super aggressive (especially for people already in the industry), but this is a newer product/concept.
I'm curious if anyone knows of a better space to be looking for companies in our scenario - or if we need to bite the bullet, go get funding, and then hire 3-4 and hope one stays on with us? We made a post on Indeed, had like 50 people apply, and 30 were super unqualified, 15 were semi-qualified but didn't read the description stating it was commission only for the first 3 months, ,about 5 were fairly qualified, but the commission aspect is the primary roadblock. We know there is risk in hiring, but we are just at a point where we cant throw away 20k for 3 months of someone that didnt work out.

Sales people take time to ramp - average ramping time of an AE is about 6 months.
Is it maybe possible you’re doing a disservice to everyone (including yourselves) by looking for a sales person at this stage?
Realistically - the talent you’re looking for is probably making 100k base salary at other places, and many don’t have the risk appetite to be the guniea pig of a GTM strategy.
How do you define traction? 1 customer? 10? 200? - Do you have a sales process that’s repeatable? How long does it take to close a deal? What’s the average contract value? Where are the leads coming from? What happens if you think it’s a bad fit 3 months in? - These are all basic questions that a potential sale rep will ask you before even considering joining.
Aggressive commission structure is pretty meaningless if there isn’t a solid path to get there. This is something that hurts everyone.
If you’re open to advice, stick to founder led sales for a bit, create a sales process that is repeatable and predictable. Maybe better understand why you’re looking to hire a sales person - whats in it for them?

Commision only on a startup is a huge redflag. Nothing you offer is close to being 100% optimized yet ,(no dig, but that's the reality) yet you expect your sales team to hit their quotas.... i suggest you offer livable salaries and above normal commissions plan if you don't want your sales office to be a revolving door.
