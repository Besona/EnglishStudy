### [How Toby Fox Composed the Music of UNDERTALE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPCBm59yFfI&t=144s)
(start - 07:19)

Toby fox, creator of Undertale and all of its music **there's not much that I can say about him that hasn't already been said**
>关于他的事情已经被讲得差不多了, 我没有太多可以说的 = there's not much that I can say about him that hasn't already been said

I am just another person who played Undertale and had it become a huge part of my childhood

I'm also very **nostalgic** for it as it came out during a very **transitional period** of my life
>怀旧的 = nostalgic

>过渡阶段 = transitional period

I honestly can't describe how thankful I am for toby fox and Temmie Chang's work on this game

But this isn't a video to **gush** about Toby and Temmie 
>夸赞(喷涌, 滔滔不绝地讲) = gush

It's about the game's music and how toby made it  

Of course toby has his own **workflow in coming up with melodies**, like he'd sit at his piano and create a melody to fit a scene or a character's personality, then transpose it into his DAW and create the song around that 
>创作旋律的工作流 = workflow in coming up with melodies

This video is more so about the **practical side of things**, the building blocks **so to speak**
>实操的部分 = practical side of things

>可以说是(比喻义) = so to speak

Why? because I think it's interesting 

*To me* there's something really special about seeing how these **beloved tracks** are put together
>对我来说 = to me

>备受喜爱的旋律 = beloved tracks

So i hope this interests you too 

So what is a DAW? A DAW or digital audio workstation is a program used to make music 

Toby used FL studio to make all of his music and it's what i've been using for years now

Of course anything here can be translated into any other DAW, but this is what I'll be using for my **demonstrations**
>演示 = demonstration 

Before talking about them, i'd like to thank everyone who put together the toby fox **sample sheet**, listing every known **vst** and **sound font** toby used
>采样单 = sample sheet

>VST = Virtual Studio Technology(一种音频插件标准)

>Sound font(音频采样文件格式)

There's no way I'd have figured all this out on my own I'll go ahead and link this in the description

Toby uses a various number of **plugin** for his music **though** he **primarily** uses sound fonts
>插件 = plugin

>尽管, 虽然 = though

>主要地 = primarily

Sound fonts are essentially packs of instruments and or sound effects that can be loaded in any sound font player, but they're mostly used for **game rips of instruments** 
>裂口(n.), 撕裂(v.) = rip

>游戏中提取的音乐资源 = game rip

>游戏中的乐器声音 = game rip of instruments

For example his mario 64 sound font

His most commonly used sound font is **SGM** where you'll find many of his instruments like piano one, music box and many more 
>SGM = SoundFont General **MIDI**

>MIDI = Musical Instrument Digital Interface

The earthbound sound font is used a lot too

**Along with** many others from various games he likes
>以及 = along with

These are all available to download from the internet and free to use

I think... 

i don't really know the copyright rules on all those but anyway that isn't important **if you find this video insightful** in any way please leave a like it would help me out a lot
>你认为这个视频对你有帮助 = if you found this video insightful(有洞察力的, 有深刻见解的)

For most of toby's 8-bit sounding tracks, you're hearing either the NES VST or magical 8-bit plug-in both of which **emulate the sound chips of old 8-bit consoles**
>模仿8比特效果器音频芯片的声音 = emulate the sound chips of 8-bit consoles

**Bet you** could guess whose voice this is
>打赌你... = bet you...

[Mettaton Sound]

Usually magical 8-bit plugin is used but it doesn't have duty cycle which toby likes to use in his music sometimes
>占空比(音频术语) = duty cycle

**Essentially** it just lets you **play around with the intricacies** of **how the notes sound**
>本质上 = essentially

>调整细节 = play with intricacy(错综复杂)

>音符听起来如何 = how the notes sound

For example instead of this [Music] you could have this [Music]

Speaking of Temmie **I have no doubt** these plugins were also used in her games Escape Chasm and Dweller's Empty Path which are both great by the way
>无疑我认为... = I have no doubt...

Magical 8-bit is less traditional but gives you more of the options you'd find in a regular **synth**
>合成器 = synth(合成 = synthesize)

In this case we're using both for Your Best Friend 

I'm using these settings in NES VST

And a triangle wave in magical 8-bit 

To add the **vibrato** to this note we'll use automation on the depth
>颤音, 抑扬顿挫 = vibrato

And that's it for this song

Let's see how he made Shop which is one of my favorite songs from the OST 

This is a fresh project **other than** a **reverb bus** i've made which **i'll be routing some of my channels to**
>除了 = other than

>混响总线 = reverb bus

>我会把一些通道导向该总线 = I'll be routing some of my channels to (the reverb bus)

To begin let's set the tempo to 77 and make the base

It's made from threosk - a **stock plugin** which is a basic synthesizer
>原生插件 = stock(库存的) plugin

It has two extra **oscillators** on **by default** so let's turn those down and change our main oscillator to a triangle wave
>振荡器 = oscillators

>默认情况下 = by default


Let's **lower the octave**
>降低八度 = lower the octave

[Music]

And we're **basically almost there** **adding an envelope** to **give it some release** so **the note doesn't stop abruptly**
>基本上快完成了 = basically almost there

>增加一个包络 = adding an envelope

>增加一些释放时间 = give it some release

>音符不会唐突地停下 = the note doesn't stop abruptly

[Music]

Notice how it fades slightly now

Then add the reverb and perfect

Here's how it sounds with the notes added

**Now for the lead** this one's also **three ask** but **slightly harder to make**
>现在来制作主旋律部分 = now for the lead(指代主旋律)

>three ask在这个语境下指代three oscillators 

>稍微有点难搞 = slightly harder to make

We're using a triangle wave again

[Music]

It sounds about right but it's missing a few things let's **add the envelope in pitch** I'll add a very small amount 
>在音高中加入包络 = add the envelope in pitch

Now there should be a slight delay before it starts automating we can add that right here

And there you go again i'll add the reverb and some **EQ** maybe i'm not entirely sure but i'm gonna add it anyway
>EQ = Equalization(一种音频处理文件)
