### [The Best Games from GMTK Game Jam 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxZ_LOlFnU&t=8s)
(03:43 - 08:05)

**Another popular approach for this theme** was to take a well-known game, and completely **flip it on its head**.
>Another popular approach for this theme = Another popular take on this idea

>倒转过来 = flip it on its head

So, Inside Job is an upside-down tower defence game where you place down the minions, **rather than** the towers.
>而不是 = rather than

You've got **a bunch of** different **baddies** to pick from - each on different cooldowns - and you have to carefully **deploy** them to overwhelm the opponent's defences.
>一批 = a bunch of

>坏蛋 = baddie

>部署 = deploy

Sometimes that means making sure many enemies arrive at the towers **simultaneously**, so some **slip by unharmed**.
>同时 = simultaneously

>毫发无损地通过 = slip by unharmed

Or using a **costly power-up** to temporarily shut down the defences.
>昂贵的强化道具 = costly power-ups

**Bonus points** to Tower Attack, which also **toyed with** the "tower offence" concept.
>额外加分 = bonus points

>玩弄 = toy with

Another **genre** that's **ripe for reversal** is the **stealth game**.
>类别 = genre = category(synonym)

>适合*反转*(对于*反转*来说很成熟) = ripe for reversal

>潜行游戏 = stealth game

In Sneakerdoodle, we actually want to **be spotted by patrolling guards**.
>被巡逻的守卫看到 = be spotted by patrolling guards

You play as an **attention-hungry** **pooch** who wants to be chased by humans.
>渴望关注 = attention-hungry

>杂种狗 = pooch

But not caught and **cuddled**.
>抱住 = cuddle

So you need to **intentionally** trip these wandering **view-cones**...and then make a dash for it before you're actually caught.
>故意地 = intentionally

>视锥 = view-cone

This leads to some surprisingly clever levels as you **dart** under tables, **squeeze through tight gaps**, and carefully choose the order in which you get spotted, so **you don't find yourself trapped**.
>猛冲 = dart = barge

>从夹缝中挤过去 = squeeze through tight gaps

>你不会被困住 = you don't find yourself be trapped

**Retro games** also **provided a good opportunity for** role reversal.
>复古游戏 = retro games

>给了...一个好机会 = provide a good opportunity for

In Bricker Breaks Free, the game starts with a very familiar **set-up**: a **paddle** firing a ball towards a bundle of blocks.
>设定 = set-up

>板子 = paddle

But then things change: the camera swaps into an **isometric view** and you're now controlling the entire field of blocks as a single, **amorphous character**.
>等轴测视图 = isometric view

>无定形的角色 = amorphous character

Now you're **moving through corridors** of enemy paddles and wandering balls.
>在走廊中穿梭 = moving through corridors

You can shoot at the paddles to destroy them, but this actually uses your blocks as **ammo** - making you a tiny bit smaller with every shot you take.
>子弹 = ammo = ammunition

And the smaller you get, the more vulnerable your core becomes.

However, **it's not all bad being small** - you can use your **slimmed-down structure** to **sneak through tight gaps**.
>变小也并非一无是处 = it's not all bad being small

>修长的结构 = slimmed-down structure

>从狭缝中溜过 = sneak through tight gaps = squeeze through tight gaps

This is a fun, **frantic**, and very clever twist on an **arcade favourite**.
>疯狂的扭曲 = frantic twist

>经典街机游戏 = arcade favorite

I just love games that use the character's shifting size and shape to organically change the way you play the game.
>我真的喜欢那些利用角色不断变化的大小和形状来有机地改变你玩游戏方式的游戏。(整句翻译)

Kinda like... Snake, which actually inspired two games in the top 100.

**My favourite, though**, was VERSUS SNAKE, which turns the **sedate Nokia phone favourite** into a **legitimately scary first-person horror game**.
>然而我最喜欢的是 = My favorite, though

>沉静的诺基亚游戏 = sedate Nokia game

>真正恐怖的第一人称游戏 = legitimately scary first-person horror game

So you need to find all the apples in the room and feed them to the snake.

Or you can throw them far away from you to **distract the giant cobra** and give yourself a chance to get away.
>分散那只巨大的眼镜蛇的注意力 = distract the giant cobra

It plays on the familiar **AI patterns** of the original game, but turns it into something completely fresh.
>人工智能模式 = AI patterns

Real-world games were also **at the mercy of** our clever game jammers.
>受到...的影响 = at the mercy of

Descriptionary is a really **imaginative rethink** of Pictionary.
>富有想象力的重构 = imaginative rethink

Basically, the character tells you what to draw - just squares, lines, **arches**, and circles, with **vague directions** for where they should go.
>拱形 = arch

>模糊的指导 = vague direction

You can then **doodle** that in the box below.
>涂鸦 = doodle

Your job is to guess what you've just drawn.

It's a bit like translating the same message through 4 languages on Google Translate - you know, **things start getting a bit wonky**, but you can still figure out the **original intent**.
>事情开始稍微变得有点怪 = things start getting a bit wonky

>原始意图 = original intent

This game is **super polished** and well worth a play.
>被好好打磨过 = super-polished

I also want to **give props to** The Last Piece Standing, for being a rare chess-based game that I actually enjoy.
>表扬 = give props to

You play as the king, and have to destroy a bunch of enemy pieces that are slowly marching towards your army.

However, you can borrow the powers of the other pieces to make **massive jumps** and **diagonal leaps** across the board.
>大跳 = massive jump

>斜线走法 = diagonal leap

This **turns each bout into** a careful positioning puzzle.
>把每回合都变成了... = turn each bout into a 

Good stuff.

Another way to interpret the theme was to look at the different roles in games and relationships, and let us take the side that we don't usually get to play.

Take, for instance, Get Packing where we become the shopkeeper NPC from your typical RPG.
>以《Get Packing》为例，我们成为了典型角色扮演游戏中的店主 NPC。(整句翻译)

In each round you have a limited amount of money to spend on the weapons, shields, food, and potions, brought in by the 
brave and **copyright-dodging adventurer**.
>躲避版权问题的冒险者 = copyright-dodging adventurer

You then **flip to the store room** where you embrace your inner Leon S. Kennedy and **try to squish all this stuff into the cramped confines of a crate**.
>切换到储藏室 = flip to the store room

>试图把所有这些东西塞进狭小的箱子里 = try to squish(挤扁) all this stuff into the cramped(狭小的) confines(限制) of a crate(板条箱).

What's more, certain items can affect their surroundings - so don't put a magic flame sword next to your bananas, because the fruit will go bad.

Sure, we have seen games about being a shopkeeper, but this was still a cute game, and is worth checking out.
