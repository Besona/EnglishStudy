### [How Octopath Traveler Hypes its Boss Battles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7Zc3f8cPnU)
(start - 04:40)

The best part of a boss battle for me is often not the actual fight itself.

It’s what comes right before: **the build-up**.
>前戏 = the build-up

The **tense anticipation** as you nervously wait and **ready yourself to go face-to-face with something you have no idea what to expect from**.
>紧张地期待 = tense anticipation

>让你准备好去面对一些你完全不知道在期待什么的东西 = ready yourself to go face-to-face with something you have no idea what to expect from

And then finally it happens, the boss music **kicks in** and **the adrenaline takes over**.
>开始出现(可以运用在各种场景) = kick in

>肾上腺素开始占上风 = the adrenaline takes over

This is the same feeling that Masaaki Hayasaka had when he went to **a live gig** of one of his favourite bands.
>现场音乐会 = a live gig

He got excited whenever the band opened their songs with new extended intros that he hadn’t heard before.
>新的扩展前奏 = new extended intros

He felt that **giddy suspense** of not knowing what’s about to come, and **the euphoric moment** when you finally recognise that one **chord or riff** and it all clicks together.
>一种兴奋的悬疑感 = giddy(头晕眼花的) suspense

>极度兴奋的瞬间 = the eup

>和弦或乐句 = chord or riff

Hayasaka was inspired by **the emotional climax** achieved by these introductions and wanted to bring that same feeling to the music of the game that he was working on as a sound designer at the time: Octopath Traveler.
>情感高潮 = emotional climax

As the name suggests, in Octopath Traveler you play as an ensemble troupe of eight characters, who all travel and fight together but each have their own discrete storylines.
>整体的团 = ensemble(全体) troupe(剧团)

For instance, the scholar Cyrus is tracking down a missing **ancient tome**, the **priest** Ophelia is on **a pious pilgrimage** called the Kindling, and Primrose **seeks revenge on** the three men that murdered her father.
>古籍 = ancient tome

>牧师 = priest

>神圣的朝圣之旅 = a pious pilgrimage

>对...复仇 = seek revenge on

With personalised tales for each of the travelers, it’s easy to form a bond with these characters, quickly understanding their personality, motivations and goals.

This is something that Octopath’s composer Yasunori Nishiki was **mindful** of while writing the eight character themes, saying that melody is an important part in helping you empathise with the character, that through the theme of each character you can immediately understand where they’re from, the situation they are in, and what their journey will look like.
>上心的 = mindful

Nishiki does this not only through melody, but also instrument choice: each of the eight themes feature a unique instrument that best **embodies the spirit of that character**.
>体现了那个角色的精神 = embody the spirit of that character

Take Olberic for example: **a famed swordsman** of the fallen King who now lives in hiding in a small mountain village.
>一位著名的剑士 = a famed swordsman

His theme has **a small brassy horn** section which **feels noble yet remains humble**.
>一小段铜管 = a small brassy(刺耳的) horn(角)

>感觉高贵, 但仍然保持谦卑 = feels noble but remains humble

This theme plays during important story beats for Olberic, and is also referenced in one other track called For Redemption, which **plays in the lead-up to** the bosses that Olberic faces.
>在...开始前播放 = plays in the lead-up to...

Because the story paths are **individualised** for each character in Octopath Traveler, the bosses they face are generally much more personal - rather than fighting **a slightly more ferocious dungeon dweller**, or **some disposable cog in a grand machine** that’s looking to destroy the world, you’re generally facing **a long-time rival** or **someone who has a specific conflicting interest to that character’s own goal**.
>独立的 = individualized

>稍微有点凶猛的地下城居民 = a slightly more ferocious dungeon dwellers

>一些宏大机器中无关紧要的小杂碎 = some disposable(可任意处理的, 一次性的) cog(无足轻重的成员) in a grand machine

>长时间的对手 = a long-time rival

>与角色自身目标存在特定冲突利益的人 = someone who has a specific conflicting interest to that character's own goal

By **reintroducing** the unique instrument from the character’s theme in this moment, it reminds you of **the personal stakes at hand**.
>重新引入 = reintroduce

>当前的个人利益或风险 = a personal stakes(风险, 重要利益) at hand

But then why does it need a second theme at all?

Why not just use Olberic’s theme in this scene too?

Well what For Redemption enables is the moment that inspired Masaaki Hayasaka at the gig: the **mounting anticipation** and slow-build into a musical climax, **seamlessly flowing into** the part that the audience is all eagerly waiting for.
>增长的期待 = mounting anticipation

>无缝衔接 = seamlessly flowing into

This would usually be rather simple to do if it weren’t for one small problem: you.

You are unpredictable and have complete control over the speed at which **the scene progresses**, the game letting you read through the dialogue at your own pace.
>场景进度 = the scene progresses

Who knows, you could go make a cup of tea and leave the final dialogue box hanging - the battle only begins when you are ready and press the A button.

So instead of building one single musical climax that fits all, **as you can with** a live performance or even a **cutscene**, the music needs to be ready to react to your input and make the transition at any given moment.
>正如你可以...的那样 = as you can with...

>过场动画 = cutscene

This is achieved through a rather simple dynamic music system.
