### [In Defence of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's Soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TDN2qKjtck&t=10s)

Zelda music is important.

With a Lynel’s share of **iconic game melodies**, Zelda soundtracks are hugely popular and **deeply cherished by fans**.
>形象的游戏旋律 = iconic game melodies

>深受粉丝喜爱 = deeply cherished by fans

Music often plays a role in the games’ stories too, and there’s even a **worldwide concert tour dedicated to the series**.
>专门为系列打造的世界巡回音乐演出 = worldwide concert tour dedicated to the series

>有关"系列作品"的另一种说法 = franchise

Whenever a new Zelda game is released, there is an extraordinary expectation from fans for **its music to be of a certain calibre** and sound a particular way: Epic and heroic, with rich, memorable melodies full of adventurous spirit.
>它的音乐达到一定水准 = its music to be of a certain calibre

So with 2017’s Breath of the Wild promising a new way to experience Zelda and **trailers boasting an exciting new score**.
>预告片也爆出了令人兴奋的新配乐 = trailers boasting an exciting new scores 

**Needless to say, the hype was high**.
>无需多言, 万人空巷 = needless to say, the hype is high

While the game received no shortage of praise, opinions on the soundtrack were a bit more divided.
>游戏备受好评的同时, 配乐的看法却褒贬不一(整句翻译)

Breath of the Wild’s music wasn’t the **bombastic**, adventurous score that we expected, instead it was gentle and quiet, **at time**s** even silent.
>夸夸其谈的 = bombastic

>有时 = at times

Many fans were disappointed, feeling it wasn’t true to the established Zelda sound or spirit.

I personally love Breath of the Wild’s soundtrack and think it has **lots of wonderful melodic gems hidden within it**.
>里面藏着不少音乐宝藏 = lots of wonderful melodic gems hidden within it

**But that’s beside the point**, because the role of a soundtrack is to **score the emotion** on the screen – if it has a nice, memorable melody then that’s just a bonus.
>但这不是重点 = but that's besides the point

>刻画情感 = score the emotion

I don’t think Nintendo made the wrong decision with Breath of the Wild’s music because it perfectly **captures the emotion of the game**, and further than that, I don’t even think it sounds out of place within the series.
>

I’d argue that even more famous than Zelda’s sense of adventure is its **wildly divergent tone**.
>截然不同的情感基调 = wildly divergent(有分歧的, 岔开的, 发散的) tone

Music is so vital to the series because most new Zelda games introduce a new version of Hyrule with its own history and character, and the role of the music is to establish the **unique mood** of this world.
>独特的情绪 = unique mood

So while Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time may be heroic and adventurous, Twilight Princess and Majora’s Mask are much more dark, mysterious and **dreadful**.
>可怕的 = dreadful

Then there’s the Wind Waker’s **swashbuckling score** and the **sweeping orchestral romance** of Skyward Sword.
>宏大的配乐 = swashbuckling score

>四处弥漫的浪漫交响乐 = sweeping orchestral romance

These **distinct musical approaches** all help to **cast their respective game’s world and characters in entirely different lights**.
>不同的音乐 = distinct musical approaches

>为他们各自的世界和角色投射出不同的光芒 = cast their respective game's world and characters in entirely different lights

Compare this to one of Zelda’s **closest relatives** Metroid, which has had **creepy**, atmospheric music from the very start and has **barely strayed from that style** in the thirty years since.
>最近的亲戚 = closest relative

>诡异的 = creepy

>几乎没有偏离这种风格 = barely strayed(迷路, 走失) from this style

At least, successfully.

It shouldn’t be surprising then that Breath of the Wild sounds different to previous entries in the Zelda series.

It may not be adventurous or even dark and dangerous, but the music works just as well in establishing its unique setting.

 
Most Zelda games will open with a relatively peaceful Hyrule being thrown into **imminent peril** thanks to the rise of an evil power.
>迫在眉睫的危险 = imminent peril

It’s up to Link to prevent this from happening and keep Hyrule safe.

However in Breath of the Wild, the battle’s already been fought.

Ganon won and took over Hyrule, Link fell into a deep sleep and **it’s been this way for a hundred years**.
>就这样持续了百年 = it's been this way for a hundred years

It’s a **post-apocalyptic** Hyrule, **a broken shadow of its former self**.
>后启示录风格的 = post-apocalyptic

>是往日的破碎之影 = a broken shadow of its former self

**This is immediately made clear** as **the first thing Link sees upon waking up** and leaving his tomb is the **dilapidated ruins** of the Temple of Time – still standing, but badly damaged.
>事情立马变的清晰 = Things is immediately made clear

>林克醒来后看见的第一个东西 = the first thing Link sees upon waking up

>破旧的遗迹 = dilapidated ruins

As you approach the destroyed building you’ll occasionally hear this **fragile piano separated by seconds of just silence**.
>被几秒钟的寂静分隔开的破碎钢琴声 = fragile piano separated by seconds of just silence

It might not be **immediately obvious**, but this is actually the Song of Time from Ocarina, just **stripped to the bone** and played very slowly and loosely.
>非常明显 = immediately obvious

>剥离到了骨头 = stripped to the bone

It’s almost like half the notes have been pulled out of the music and **we’re just left with** this skeleton of the Temple of Time.
>我们只剩下了... = we're just left with...

The same is true for the Hyrule Field theme.

It feels like the bones of something greater, the **damaged remnants of a once marvellous civilization**.
>曾一度辉煌文明的断壁残垣 = damaged remnants(剩余部分) of a once marvellous civalization

Combining the fragile piano with **electronic fragments** in tracks like Sheikah Tower highlights the ruins of this ancient but technologically-advanced world.
>电子乐碎片 = electronic fragments

The music taps into this broken version of Hyrule that you’re exploring by almost sounding broken itself.
>这音乐的作用是勾勒出你正在探索的这个破败版本的海拉鲁大陆，几乎让它自身听起来也是破碎不堪的。

A lot of the time though, you won’t even hear any music at all - just the sound of the **wilderness**.
>荒野 = wilderness

Breath of the Wild embraces the quiet, because silence is just as important as sound.

Any **intro to music class** will teach about John Cage’s 4’33”, a piece of music that is four and a half minutes of rests -  in other words, pure silence.
>音乐课导论 = intro to music class

4’33” is **a bit of a cheeky way** of saying that music isn’t just instruments playing notes and chords – it can be any noise you want it to be, even **the quiet stillness** of your environment, if you were to just listen to it.
>有点不厚道的做法 = a bit of cheeky way

>完全静止 = the quiet stillness

The silence of Breath of the Wild not only lends itself to the game’s emotional tone, but **serves functional purposes as well**.
>也服务于功能性的目的 = serve functional purposes as well

For one, it prevents the themes from getting repetitive and annoying across the dozens of hours you’ll spend **traversing Hyrule’s landscape**.
>横渡海拉鲁大陆的风景 = traversing Hyrule's landscape

It also allows the music to better elevate dramatic moments important to the story, such as Link’s memories revealed **along the way**, or the Divine Beast dungeons.
>在旅途中 = along the way

Sometimes though, these moments are much more subtle.

Storms are awful – you can’t climb, you can’t see, you can’t build a fire so no resting or cooking food, you risk being struck by lightning and you can’t use any metal items.

Worst of all, unless you’re in a specific area no music plays during a storm.

But when the sun finally breaks through the clouds and the **storm subsides**, the music will fade in to signal the return of safety.
>风暴平息 = storm subsides

 
Other times the music will start playing **for no apparent reason** at all, scoring a nothing moment like **chopping down a tree** or **scaling a cliff face**.
>没有明确原因 = for no apparent reason

>砍倒大树 = chopping down a tree

>爬悬崖峭壁 = scaling a cliff face

To me **this kind of harkens** back to those bigger moments, **turning something menial into something meaningful**.
>这些花心思的地方 = this kind of harkens

>让琐碎的小事意义非凡 = turning something menial(卑微的) into something meaningful

It’s a reminder that everything you do is important and working towards your greater goal of defeating Ganon and **restoring Hyrule to its former glory**.
>让海拉鲁恢复往日荣光 = restoring Hyrule to its former glory

Silence also enables the music to pull you closer to the world, making it feel smaller.

Kass might be a single bird, but you can hear his **accordion** in a area around him, drawing you towards him.
>手风琴 = accordion
>
>把你拉向他 = drawing you towards them

It’s the same with the **stables** or villages **peppered throughout the map** – **the slow fade-in of the music** guides you to them.
>马厩 = stable

>星罗棋布 = peppered throughout the map

>音乐的缓慢引入 = the slow fade-in of the music

Battles too, though this does sometimes have the opposite effect.

**This gentle tugging of the ear** can also be felt in the music’s recording.
>这种柔和的听觉体验 = this gentle tugging(拉扯) of the ear

**Following the precedent set with** Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild’s soundtrack is full of real, live-recorded instruments, **adding a nice physicality to the score**.
>...珠玉在前 = follow the precedent set with...(UT has a reputation precedes itself.)

>为乐曲引入了一种很嗨的实体感 = adding a nice physicality to the score

There’s a strong emphasis on solo performances, **creating an air of intimacy**, and the **timbre** of some of these instruments, such as the shakuhachi in the Kakariko Village theme, have a real **airy and organic texture**.
>创造了一种亲近感 = creating an air of intimacy

>音色 = timbre

>轻快且自然的质感 = airy and organic texture

If you listen carefully, you can sometimes even hear the performer breathing.

This pulls you closer to the music itself, **tuning your ear to its intricacies**.
>是你的耳朵感受到乐曲的错综复杂之处 = tuning your ear to its intricacies

It’s little touches like these that give Breath of the Wild’s score its intimate feeling.

All of this lends itself to an overarching feeling of sorrow.
>所有这些都导致了一种主题上的悲伤情感

The **contemplative space** found within the silence.
>静思的空间 = contemplative space

The **intimate and tender** instrument solos.
>亲切而温柔 = intimate and tender(嫩的, 温柔的)

The damaged piano tracks, an instrument which to me feels very **introspective and melancholic**.
>内省且忧郁 = introspective and melancholic

These three feelings – brokenness, intimacy and sorrow – when combined, they result in **burden**.
>责任 = burden

When you are deeply upset about something that is wrong, you **feel a personal weight of responsibility** to make it right.
>有一种使命感 = feel a personal weight of responsibility

This is **presumably** the burden that Link feels.
>大概 = presumably

100 years ago he was Princess Zelda’s knight in the fight against Ganon and he failed.

While many of Hyrule’s citizens are optimistic about Link’s return, others are angry and still blame him for what happened.

**I don’t think it’s too far-fetched to say** that our silent protagonist probably blames himself too and feels a little ashamed.
>我认为说...并不过分 = I don't think it's too far-fetched to say

We do see this much more clearly in Zelda.

It wasn’t so much Link’s responsibility to protect Hyrule as much as it was the Princess’s.

She was born with the burden of Hyrule placed on her shoulders and **dedicates her whole life trying to live up to this duty**, but is unable to achieve what is required of her.
>倾尽她的一生去完成这项使命 = dedicates her whole life to live up this duty

Zelda **is haunted by her past failures** and **resents her perceived inability** to protect Hyrule.
>被过去的失败所困扰 = be haunted(萦绕) with her past failures

>对自己的无能感到愧疚 = resents(感到愧疚) her perceived(察觉的) inability

To me, Breath of the Wild isn’t a game about having **lofty adventures** through a fantastic world – Link isn’t Bilbo Baggins leaving the Shire **for the sake of the adventure** and Zelda isn’t a **kidnapped** Princess in need of rescue; it’s a more personal tale of redemption, for Zelda, Link and Hyrule, **steeped in brokenness and failure**, but with just a touch of hope.
>崇高的冒险 = lofty adventure

>只为了冒险 = for the sake of the adventure

>被绑架的 = kidnapped

>充满破碎和失败 = steeped(浸泡, 使...充满) with brokenness and failure

The music **perfectly captures** this emotional core of the game, in a way that **catchy earworms** and **rousing, heroic fanfares** just can’t do.
>完美契合 = perfectly capture

>引人入胜的旋律 = catchy earworms

>激昂, 英勇的曲子 = rousing, heroic fanfares

Thank you to my Patreon family for actually making this video possible.

With their support I was able to purchase a **game capture card** and make this video that I’ve wanted to for months.
>游戏采集卡 = game capture card
