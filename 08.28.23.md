### [How Final Fantasy VII Remade its Soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59c3xz76M80)
(begin - 05:03)

The Final Fantasy VII Remake is **unprecedented**.
>先例 = precedent, 前所未有的 = unprecedented

While we’ve recently seen a number of games **being rebuilt from the ground up**, **offering a modern update to an aging classic**, none of them **come close to the scope or ambition of 7 Remake**.
>从头开始重建 = being rebuilt from ground up

>为经典老游戏提供现代化更新 = offering a modern update to an aging classic

>与FF7RE的范围和野心相提并论 = come close to the scope or ambition of 7 Remake

The city of Midgar, originally a 3-5 hour **prologue** to Final Fantasy VII, **has been transformed into a fully-fledged 30-50 hour standalone experience**.
>序章 = prologue

>已经被改编成一个完整的, 30-50小时的独立体验 = has been transformed into a fully-fledged(羽毛丰满的, 成熟的) 30-50 hours standalone(独立的) experience.

And it’s **utterly deserving** - **Midgar is a fascinating dystopian city**, and **spending only a few hours there never did it justice**.
>完全值得 = utterly deserving

>米德加是一个迷人的反乌托邦城市 = Midgar is a fascinating dystopian city

>只逛几小时无法领略其魅力(做出公正评价) = spending only a few hours there never did it justice

The themes Midgar represents of human environmental destruction and late-stage corporate capitalism are more relevant in 2020 than they ever were back in 1997.
>米德加尔所代表的人类环境破坏和晚期企业资本主义的主题, 在2020年比1997年更加相关(整句翻译)

But humanity’s perpetual descent into an ecological apocalypse at the hand of unmitigated capitalist gain is not the only thing that’s changed in the past two decades - video games have also changed.
>然而，人类不断陷入生态末日的境地，这一切都是由于无节制的资本主义获益所致，并不是过去两十年里发生变化的唯一事情 - 视频游戏也发生了变化。

>不断地 = perpetual

>陷入 = descent into

>环境末日 =  ecological apocalypse

>由于 = at the hand of

>资本主义的无节制索取 = unmitigated capitalist gain

The technical restrictions faced in the 90’s **have been all but eliminated**, allowing the game to tell its story **with so much more grace and nuance**.
>已经全部被消除 = have been all but eliminated

>有着更多的优雅和细微差别 = with so much more grace and nuance(细微差别)

And just one of the ways it achieves this is through its music.

Remake is an entirely different game to Final Fantasy VII, and thus it **requires an entirely different approach to its soundtrack**.
>需要一种完全不同的配乐方式 = requires an entirely different approach to its soundtrack

Square-Enix **embraced this opportunity to deepen the musical storytelling of the game**, with new arrangements of old tracks, **new tracks featuring old motifs**, and rethinking how music **is implemented** into the game.
>抓住了这个机会来深化了游戏的音乐叙事 = embrace this opportunity to deepen the musical storytelling of the game

>旧主题的新曲目 = new tracks featuring ole motifs

>被融入 = be implemented

It **presents** us with a unique opportunity to explore **how the role of video game music has evolved over the past 20 years**.
>这呈现给我们一个独特的机会来探索在过去20年中视频游戏配乐的角色是如何发展的(整句翻译)

So this is how Final Fantasy VII remake its soundtrack for the modern era.

The most obvious change between the two games’ soundtracks is its **audio fidelity**.
>音频保真度 = audio fidelity

Although the PS1 could offer CD-quality audio **on par with** modern recordings, Final Fantasy VII’s soundtrack was instead created using the Playstation’s internal sound chip.
>与...相媲美 = on par with

Even though CD-quality audio was technically possible, it takes up a lot of space on those CDs, which was needed for other things such as the game.

CD-quality audio just wasn’t **feasible** for a game of FF7's size, which was already **stretched across 3 discs**.
>可行的 = feasible

>占据了三张光盘 = be stretched across 3 discs

This is not such a problem in 2020.

**Aside from** modern digital instrument samples sounding pretty authentic now, **consoles** come installed with **massive hard drives** which have minimized the limitations due to storage, and audio fills a **comparatively** much smaller space in a game when it looks like this.
>除了 = aside from

>console可以翻译为游戏机

>大硬盘 = massive hard drives

>相对来说 = comparatively

Remake embraces the symphonic sound that the original could only suggest, with fully orchestrated performances of the classic tunes.
>重制版采用原版只能想想的交响乐声音, 充斥着管线乐版本的经典旋律 

However not every track from Final Fantasy VII aimed for the orchestra.

Many **leaned into** the **electronica palette**, such as the **grimy** bass-driven theme of the slums, Underneath the Rotting Pizza.
>引起,导致(采用) = lean into

>电子风格(调色) = electronica palette

>脏的, 污秽的 = grimy

>slum = 贫民窟

And of course there is Uematsu’s love for **progressive rock** that **shines through**, particularly in the battle and boss themes.
>植松 = Uematsu

>渐进摇滚 = progressive rock

>显而易见 = shine enough

These tracks are all given the Remake treatment with appropriate arrangements that realise the intention of the original.

While the Remake enables **faithful adaptations** of the original’s tunes, it also allows for some more... **creative interpretations**.
>忠实改编 = faithful adaptation

>创意性的诠释 = creative interpretation

From **a dub reggae remix** of the track The Oppressed, to… whatever Hip Hop de Chocobo is?
>有配音的雷鬼remix = a dub reggae remix

These more **liberal arrangements** are put to great effect with some of the game’s **recurring motifs**.
>自由的改编 = liberal arrangements

>反复出现的主题 = recurring motif

Take Tifa, for example.

In the original game, Tifa gets her own theme.

But that's it - apart from a quick reference in the ending movement, this is the exact piece of music that plays pretty much every time there’s an important Tifa scene.
