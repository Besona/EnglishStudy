### [How Final Fantasy VII Remade its Soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59c3xz76M80)
(05:03 - 09:32)

The first time we see Tifa in the Remake, we get a **faithful, orchestral rendition** of her original theme.
>忠实的, 管弦乐版的演出 = faithful, orchestral rendition

It feels familiar and comforting, you **swell up with love** when you see her and hear the music again after all these years - potentially similar to how Cloud feels having his childhood friend around once again.
>因爱感动/充满爱意 = swell up with love

Not long after **we are treated to a cozy lounge rendition of Tifa's theme**, when she mixes a drink for Cloud at her bar and they have a little chat.
>我们享受到了一个温馨旅馆版本的蒂法主题曲 = we're treated with a cozy lounge rendition of Tifa's theme

This version is more representative of Tifa in her job as **bartender** of Seventh Heaven - you can almost **picture a quartet in the corner of the room** playing the song.
>酒保 = bartender

>想想房间的角落有一个四重奏 = picture a quartet in the corner of the room

Finally, much later, we get a high energy **EDM** version of her theme, when Tifa and Aerith **beat up the perverts**.
>EDM = Electronic Dance Music

>制止坏人 = beat up perverts

These additional arrangements of Tifa's Theme aren't as faithful to the original, but they help to **flesh out her character** and score the different situations she finds herself in.
>让她的角色更加立体 = flesh out her character

Tifa of course is not the only character to be given this treatment, in fact the use of her leitmotif is rather simple.

In particular, there are a ton of variations on the Shinra theme.

Though a number of these instances are actually variations on the main battle theme, titled “Let The Battles Begin!”, which features the Shinra motif as a constant reminder of who the enemy is and what you’re fighting for.

This battle theme however isn't actually used in the same way as it was in the original, because combat in the Remake has been completely **overhauled**.
>彻底检查, 大修 = overhaul

There are no random encounters in 7 Remake, and entering combat doesn’t transport you to a **separate screen**; it’s all integrated within the field.
>分离的界面 = separate screen

This is something Square have been trying to do since Final Fantasy XII, but **they’ve struggled to make it work**.
>他们一直难以使其成功 = they've struggled to make it work

In XII there was no battle screen transition, and no change in the music to even establish the fact you’re in combat.

XIII’s encounters weren’t random, but still sent you to a **discrete battle sequence** for combat, with its own theme that often got cut off as soon as it was beginning to **ramp up**.
>独立的战斗场景(序列) = discrete battle sequence

>升温(上升) = ramp up(筹资那集遇见过)

And XV returned to having no screen transition, but **cued in a battle track** anyway, and the result was a little jarring.
>播放战斗音乐 = cue(提示, 暗示, 线索) in battle track

>刺耳的, 不和谐的 = jarring

But in 7 Remake **they have finally managed to find a way that flows naturally by forgoing a traditional battle theme**, but **dynamically introducing extra elements into the area theme during combat**.
>他们终于成功地找到了一种自然流畅的方式，放弃了传统的战斗音乐(主题) = they have finally managed to find a way that flows naturally by forgoing a traditional battle theme

>在战斗期间动态地引入了额外的元素到区域音乐(主题) = dynamically introducing extra elements into the area theme during combat

I won’t get into this too much, as there is already an excellent video by 8-Bit Music Theory discussing how they achieved this with the Mako Reactor theme.

But essentially, the intensity of these usually rather chill area themes is ramped up in real-time by fading in more layers of instrumentation whenever combat is initiated.
>但是从本质上来讲, 每当战斗开始时, 这些通常相当轻松的区域主题会通过淡入更多的乐器层次来实时提高强度(整句翻译)

7 Remake is **certainly not** the first game to do this, in fact it’s become quite **commonplace**, but it’s just one of the ways that Final Fantasy finally feels modern again.
>无疑不是 = certainly not

>老生常谈的 = commonplace
