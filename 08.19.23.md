3. They both got accepted into Cambridge University’s **med** program. I think only 5 or 10 applicants got accepted from all of Canada. One’s a **neurosurgeon** and the other a **cardiologist** now.

5. What do these boys have in common?
>这些男孩有什么共同点?

6. Yeah, **tbh** I know I'm going to **get hate** but I just don't like how **fandoms** make nice characters, soft **femboys**. Like with Undertale it's with Papyrus which is not **in character** and I hate, with dealtarune it's with Ralsei, which I don't like as I just don't **personally** see it, with **Sonic the hedgehog franchise** it's with **Tails**, who they **sexualize** which I find weird and disgusting as Tails is **canonically** 8 years old.
>tbh = to be honest

>get hate = 招人恨

>fandoms = 粉丝

>femboy = 女性化的男角色

>in character = 符合性格

>canonically = 事实上, 按照规矩的

>以及这个段落中大量出现的句式: With (game) it's with (character) which is (comment) and (Personal feelings)

7. I mean it's okay **imho** people free to **headcanon** things. it's not like there isn't **a big pile of** **lore accurate** works too. you gotta just look into more **mainstream fandom layers or the niche** of authors who try their best to **replicate** the feeling, style and characters of the **original piece**.
>imho = In My Humble Opinion 依我愚见

>headcanon, 互联网术语，通常用于讨论文化作品, 指粉丝对作品中未明确阐述或未正式确认的设定的个人理解

>lore accurate = 忠于原著

>mainstream fandom layers or the niche = 主流粉丝圈层 or 小众(粉丝圈层)

>replicate = 复刻

用法: adj. + piece

8. if you are interested in a really **good in-character** Papyrus, i recommend reading the Inverted Fate comic. It's an **au**, but it's really **well-written, composed** and in my opinion **not only** perfectly match original characters **but also** greatly expands them.
>good in-character = 忠于角色

>au = Alternative Universe 平行宇宙

>well + v.-ed 在...方面做的出色 e.g: well-written, composed

>not only... but also... 不仅...而且...

9. I don’t know it **takes some guts** to get up and **tackle** each day. ... but there are those that get up and really try and make the world better I just started to **have a better outlook**.
> takes some guts = 需要勇气

> tackle 很好用的一个词, 意为: 处理某些事

> hold myself all together = 让我振作起来

> every so often = 隔三岔五

11. Yeah, **the few times these thoughts came up**, I always couldn't make myself put my parents and sister through it. They've been very good to me, and it's not fair to put them through shit just because of my own issues. That was **reinforced** once i saw my uncle become broken after his daughter went the wrong way off a balcony **intentionally**.
>the few times = 有些时候, come up = 出现

>reinforced = 被强化

>intentionally = 故意的

12. My twin brother just **committed**, and **it's been 2 months today that I found him**. **Ironically**, it was him that **kept me from doing** it 20 years ago. I didn't want to leave him alone in this world to deal with our fucked up family. Now I have a son, he's 14. He has **autism** and other things. His dad is useless. I may not have wanted to be a mom, but I'm **determined to be** the best damn mom to him I can be. I have all the examples of what not to do. I've been asked **multiple times** since my brother's passing if 'they' need to worry about me doing the same thing. And my answer is always the same, "If my son is breathing, then so am I."

13.  (OP, check the full piece in upper link)...I felt **instant attraction**. I’ve been **reminiscing** about him, **fantasising** and wishing that I could have something more with him. **Meanwhile**, I **developed my feelings pretty quick so did he as well**. It was **mutual** and we both expressed to each other how we felt. **The only thing that bothered me** was age difference. I **turned 22** and he turned 41 this year. ...However, we’ve been together for some time but **I’m scared of the reaction** when my family finds out. Not scared, but a bit concerned. They are very **closed minded** and **conservative** people and honestly, I don’t want to lie about my relationship **further more** but sometimes it seems like it’s best thing to do. It still bothers me sometimes. One day I would love for him to meet my family if it **comes to that point**. I’m happy right now. he’s been helping me a lot with my mental situation and life **in general**. ...
>instant attraction = 立刻被吸引了, reminiscing = 回忆, fascinating = 幻想

>scare of... = 害怕...

>in general = 总之

14. My wife is about 10 year younger. **Culture matters more than I would have thought**. **Watching every pop culture reference you make evaporate in front of her would be tough**. **It’s tough** explaining some things now. I half jokingly say the **iron curtain** saved us because everything western got to her 10 years late.
>Culture matters more than I would have thought. 文化问题比我预想的还要严重 但是英语的表达"Culture matters more"放在了前面

>Watching every pop culture reference you make evaporate in front of her would be tough. 你提到的所有流行文化都在她面前烟消云散,这就很搞  

>Watching... would be tough.是句子主干, 剩下的填料也很有趣,值得学习的句子

>It’s tough doing... 做某事很困难

>iron curtain = 铁幕

15. My friend **did end up divorced**, her mom never did and her dad died in his 70s so she was pretty young when it happened, **considering**. Like you say, age definitely means something, and **I’d argue** it means a lot more when one person is under 30.
>did end up divorced (did end up sth.)

>considering = 考虑到这一点

>I'd argue = 我得说...
