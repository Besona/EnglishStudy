### [In Defence of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's Soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TDN2qKjtck&t=10s)
(begin - 07:11)

Zelda music is important.

With a Lynel’s share of **iconic game melodies**, Zelda soundtracks are hugely popular and **deeply cherished by fans**.
>形象的游戏旋律 = iconic game melodies

>深受粉丝喜爱 = deeply cherished by fans

Music often plays a role in the games’ stories too, and there’s even a **worldwide concert tour dedicated to the series**.
>专门为系列打造的世界巡回音乐演出 = worldwide concert tour dedicated to the series

>有关"系列作品"的另一种说法 = franchise

Whenever a new Zelda game is released, there is an extraordinary expectation from fans for **its music to be of a certain calibre** and sound a particular way: Epic and heroic, with rich, memorable melodies full of adventurous spirit.
>它的音乐达到一定水准 = its music to be of a certain calibre

So with 2017’s Breath of the Wild promising a new way to experience Zelda and **trailers boasting an exciting new score**.
>预告片也爆出了令人兴奋的新配乐 = trailers boasting an exciting new scores 

**Needless to say, the hype was high**.
>无需多言, 万人空巷 = needless to say, the hype is high

While the game received no shortage of praise, opinions on the soundtrack were a bit more divided.
>游戏备受好评的同时, 配乐的看法却褒贬不一(整句翻译)

Breath of the Wild’s music wasn’t the **bombastic**, adventurous score that we expected, instead it was gentle and quiet, **at time**s** even silent.
>夸夸其谈的 = bombastic

>有时 = at times

Many fans were disappointed, feeling it wasn’t true to the established Zelda sound or spirit.

I personally love Breath of the Wild’s soundtrack and think it has **lots of wonderful melodic gems hidden within it**.
>里面藏着不少音乐宝藏 = lots of wonderful melodic gems hidden within it

**But that’s beside the point**, because the role of a soundtrack is to **score the emotion** on the screen – if it has a nice, memorable melody then that’s just a bonus.
>但这不是重点 = but that's besides the point

>刻画情感 = score the emotion

I don’t think Nintendo made the wrong decision with Breath of the Wild’s music because it perfectly **captures the emotion of the game**, and further than that, I don’t even think it sounds out of place within the series.
>

I’d argue that even more famous than Zelda’s sense of adventure is its **wildly divergent tone**.
>截然不同的情感基调 = wildly divergent(有分歧的, 岔开的, 发散的) tone

Music is so vital to the series because most new Zelda games introduce a new version of Hyrule with its own history and character, and the role of the music is to establish the **unique mood** of this world.
>独特的情绪 = unique mood

So while Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time may be heroic and adventurous, Twilight Princess and Majora’s Mask are much more dark, mysterious and **dreadful**.
>可怕的 = dreadful

Then there’s the Wind Waker’s **swashbuckling score** and the **sweeping orchestral romance** of Skyward Sword.
>宏大的配乐 = swashbuckling score

>四处弥漫的浪漫交响乐 = sweeping orchestral romance

These **distinct musical approaches** all help to **cast their respective game’s world and characters in entirely different lights**.
>不同的音乐 = distinct musical approaches

>为他们各自的世界和角色投射出不同的光芒 = cast their respective game's world and characters in entirely different lights

Compare this to one of Zelda’s **closest relatives** Metroid, which has had **creepy**, atmospheric music from the very start and has **barely strayed from that style** in the thirty years since.
>最近的亲戚 = closest relative

>诡异的 = creepy

>几乎没有偏离这种风格 = barely strayed(迷路, 走失) from this style

At least, successfully.

It shouldn’t be surprising then that Breath of the Wild sounds different to previous entries in the Zelda series.

It may not be adventurous or even dark and dangerous, but the music works just as well in establishing its unique setting.

 
Most Zelda games will open with a relatively peaceful Hyrule being thrown into **imminent peril** thanks to the rise of an evil power.
>迫在眉睫的危险 = imminent peril

It’s up to Link to prevent this from happening and keep Hyrule safe.

However in Breath of the Wild, the battle’s already been fought.

Ganon won and took over Hyrule, Link fell into a deep sleep and **it’s been this way for a hundred years**.
>就这样持续了百年 = it's been this way for a hundred years

It’s a **post-apocalyptic** Hyrule, **a broken shadow of its former self**.
>后启示录风格的 = post-apocalyptic

>是往日的破碎之影 = a broken shadow of its former self

**This is immediately made clear** as **the first thing Link sees upon waking up** and leaving his tomb is the **dilapidated ruins** of the Temple of Time – still standing, but badly damaged.
>事情立马变的清晰 = Things is immediately made clear

>林克醒来后看见的第一个东西 = the first thing Link sees upon waking up

>破旧的遗迹 = dilapidated ruins

As you approach the destroyed building you’ll occasionally hear this **fragile piano separated by seconds of just silence**.
>被几秒钟的寂静分隔开的破碎钢琴声 = fragile piano separated by seconds of just silence

It might not be **immediately obvious**, but this is actually the Song of Time from Ocarina, just **stripped to the bone** and played very slowly and loosely.
>非常明显 = immediately obvious

>剥离到了骨头 = stripped to the bone

It’s almost like half the notes have been pulled out of the music and **we’re just left with** this skeleton of the Temple of Time.
>我们只剩下了... = we're just left with...

The same is true for the Hyrule Field theme.

It feels like the bones of something greater, the damaged remnants of a once marvellous civilization.

Combining the fragile piano with **electronic fragments** in tracks like Sheikah Tower highlights the ruins of this ancient but technologically-advanced world.
>电子乐碎片 = electronic fragments

The music taps into this broken version of Hyrule that you’re exploring by almost sounding broken itself.
>这音乐的作用是勾勒出你正在探索的这个破败版本的海拉鲁大陆，几乎让它自身听起来也是破碎不堪的。

A lot of the time though, you won’t even hear any music at all - just the sound of the **wilderness**.
>荒野 = wilderness

Breath of the Wild embraces the quiet, because silence is just as important as sound.

Any **intro to music class** will teach about John Cage’s 4’33”, a piece of music that is four and a half minutes of rests -  in other words, pure silence.
>音乐课导论 = intro to music class

4’33” is **a bit of a cheeky way** of saying that music isn’t just instruments playing notes and chords – it can be any noise you want it to be, even **the quiet stillness** of your environment, if you were to just listen to it.
>有点不厚道的做法 = a bit of cheeky way

>完全静止 = the quiet stillness
