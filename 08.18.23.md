I see a lot of hopefuls here glamorizing VCs and fundraising. Too much survivor bias. Hopefully my story can give you another perspective.

Quit my executive job at a FAANG. Started a SaaS as a first time founder. Raised a modest amount (under a million) and got to work alone.

Hit a lot of roadblocks but figured things out until I found product market fit. Boy was that lonely. Everyone, and I mean everyone, told me it wouldn’t work.

I hired a couple of people who were great but wouldn’t look good on a pitch deck. I didn’t care because I was heads down building, selling, and delivering the product. My small team was amazing.

Then the VCs showed up. The same ones who wouldn’t take my call before are now reaching out. I ended up raising a lot of money. Way more than I needed. Biggest mistake I made but I’ll get to that later.

The VC wanted me to grow faster and gave me impossible targets to hit. When I gently protested, he’d introduce me to founders in his portfolio to talk to and see how they did it. I realized later that those 2 founders were the only founders in his 100+ portfolio who hit those targets. More importantly, I’m his third biggest company! But he’d never give me a chance to feel that way because they’re in the business of making you work till you drop, not in celebrating your “great” success. They want the most success.

Anyway, by then I had over $10m in the bank for a startup of 5 people making low 7 figures from well established and extremely happy customers. Things couldn’t be better. At least that’s what I think now I’m hindsight. The VCs want you to be a rocket ship. Being content with this is their worst situation because now you’d be paid well and doing what you love while they are waiting for you to cash out. If they don’t push you to hate this status quo, you’ll lose momentum and they’ll lose the bet. I hope this part is clear because it’s the crux of the misalignment between founders and VCs.

Anyway, I was told to hire a lot of people. Put fuel on the fire they said. Bring industry experts who can move the needle. All this BS you hear all day. All failed. I hired VPs and bloated my payroll. Ultimately I ended up with a bunch of highly paid employees who don’t know how to do anything but to “build and lead amazing teams.” Imagine you hire someone to scale an area and their solution is to divide that area into 5 sub areas and hire someone for each of them to figure it out, etc. that’s their solution.

Anyway, I ended up focusing my efforts on hiring and ramping up those VPs and dealing with their dumb ideas instead of focusing on my 3 core tenants: build, sell, and support.

Now who suffered? My customers and my original employees. My customers started experiencing poor SLA and we missed a lot of deadlines, so they started to cancel. My original employees would complain to their new bosses but the new bosses would criticize how things had been done.

All in all we went from $0 to $100m to $0 because I followed the advice of the VCs.

Thanks for letting me share my story.
