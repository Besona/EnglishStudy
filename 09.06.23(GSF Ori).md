### [Scoring Ori's Ginso Tree Escape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTT3piMjqmM)
(start - 04:36)

There’s something really special about Ori and the Blind Forest.

I mean, so much of it is wonderful.

The hand-crafted art style, the momentum in Ori’s movement, the insane platforming in the chase sequences, the incredible music by Gareth Coker.

But somehow the game ends up being even greater than the sum of all these parts, and I put this down to a rather **intangible** idea called flow.
>难以捉摸的 = intangible

The controls, the music and level design all work together to **serve a single purpose**: to create a **cadence** and rhythm in the gameplay that makes you feel at one with Ori and the forest of Nibel.
>为了一个目的服务 = serve a single purpose 

>节奏, 韵律 = cadence

It’s tough writing music for games because the action is going to be different every single time someone plays it.

**The interactive nature of games** means you can’t have one piece of music that will hit every single beat 100% of the time, like you can in a film.
>游戏的互动性 = the interactive nature of games

So we have other methods.

Dynamic music systems can be built to react to a player’s actions in real time, but these are often very complicated and time-consuming to create.

Ori and the Blind Forest actually uses a very basic dynamic music system, **relying entirely on precise trigger points to transition from one track to another**.
>完全依赖精确的触发点来实现从一段音轨到另一段音轨的过渡 = relying entirely on precise trigger points to transition from one track to another

So when you first reach the Spirit Caverns, this is the music you hear.

When you find the area’s upgrade, the wall jump, it triggers a transition to this version of the track.

The music is now much more bouncy and **lofty**, just like Ori is with his new-found ability, reinforcing that sense of progression.
>崇高的, 高的 = lofty

On the other end of the spectrum are cutscenes, which remove the player’s control entirely, essentially turning the game into a movie and allowing for that single piece of music **tailor-made** for the scene.
>光谱 = spectrum

>过场动画 = cutscene

>量体裁衣的 = tailor-made

Ori and the Blind Forest does this as well, in fact it opens with a ten minute cutscene but has moments of interactivity peppered throughout out.

The prologue may feel like one movement, but according to Gareth Coker, it’s actually broken up into about 20 different sections, all **seamlessly stitched** together in order to score the action - using short musical phrases in the non-interactive moments, and transitioning to music loops when the player **assumes control**.
>无缝缝合 = seamlessly stitched

>夺取控制权 = assume control

Then there’s an option that falls somewhere in between these two: going on-rails.
>接着, 还有一个介于这两者之间的选择: 走"导轨式"路线(整句翻译)

Here the player is given control over everything except the speed with which they move forward, giving the level **a set pace**.
>一个确定的节奏 = a set pace

This can be useful because the **arc of the level** is much more predictable, making it easier to score specific moments of action.
>关卡的曲线 = arc of the level

For a great, detailed look at scoring an on-rails section of a game, check out 8-Bit Music Theory’s video on Kid Icarus: Uprising.

Ori and the Blind Forest doesn’t have an on-rails section – which makes total sense.

Movement is the **cornerstone** of Ori’s gameplay, so it would be downright baffling to remove it.
>基石 = cornerstone

>完全的令人疑惑 = downright baffling

But it does have a level with a similar kind of philosophy: the escape from the Ginso Tree.

This is the first of the game’s three chase sequences, a challenging platforming **gauntlet** that tests your skill in the newly acquired Bash ability, which allows Ori to launch itself off objects, **projectiles**, and even enemies.
>难关 = gauntlet

>弹射物, 发射物 = projectile 

The Ginso Tree escape has you rocketing up the tree, **bashing** and jumping and running and dying.
猛击! = bash
