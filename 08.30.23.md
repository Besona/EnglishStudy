### [How Final Fantasy VII Remade its Soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59c3xz76M80)
(09:32 - end)

So standard battles don’t have a **single dedicated battle theme**, but **rather** new battle arrangements of the area themes.
>单独适配的战斗曲 = single dedicated battle theme

>而是 = rather

Instead, “Let The Battles Begin!” is used in the Remake to emphasise the important story battles.

But it too receives a **bespoke new version** for each encounter it’s used in to provide a more curated emotion for that specific fight.
>定做的新版本 = bespoke(定做的) new version

>精心策划的情感 = curated emotion

Shinra officers, there is **desperation** in the track with its rapid drum beat and **sharp orchestral stabs**.
>尖锐的管弦乐音符 = sharp orchestral stabs(戳, 穿刺)

But when he’s helping to find and rescue some kids taken by a monster, the same theme takes on a much more **mysterious and methodical sound**.
>神秘而有条不紊的音乐 = mysterious and methodical sound

The boss battles take things even further.

Each boss brings **a unique twist** to combat that you'll need to recognise and counter if you want to **take them out quickly**, and they will change their strategy at various points as you **whittle down their health**.
>独特的变化 = a unique twist

>快速地击败他们 = take them out quickly

>削减他们的生命值 = whittle down their health

The music reacts to each of these new phases in the battle, evolving to match the changing pace of the fight.

**To illustrate this**, we’re going to take a look at the most **incredible**, epic boss battle track in the entire game.
>为了详细解释 = to illustrate this

>难以置信的, 不可思议的 = incredible

I am of course talking about the time you fight a house.

The Hell House battle starts off with it bouncing about on its foundations, and its theme leans into the haunted house idea by using an **electric organ** and almost sounding like **carnival music**.
>电子风琴 = electric organ

>嘉年华音乐 = carnival music

But it also sneaks in references to “Let The Battles Begin”.

>但它也巧妙地引入了对“Let The Battles Begin”的引用(整句翻译) 

Entering the second phase has the Hell House **sprout legs** and charge at you, and the music **ups the intensity** by swapping out the battle theme with the original boss theme, “Those Who Fight Further”.
>长腿 = sprout(萌芽) legs

>上强度 = up the intensity

In its final phase, the Hell House just starts flying about and **shooting projectiles at you**, and the music responds by going equally as insane, with a roaring electric guitar solo and some **choral chanting** that’s usually **reserved for Sephiroth**.
>向你发射导弹 = shooting projectiles at you

>圣歌合唱 = choral chanting

>留给萨菲罗斯的 = reserved for Sephiroth

By the end of the fight, it’s just **become so extra** in the best possible way.
>变得异常夸张 = become so extra

Like many of the new tracks in 7 Remake, the Hell House battle theme is **built around musical motifs present in the original**, but the game also **features many tracks** with entirely new material as well.
>以原作中存在的音乐主题为基础构建的 = build around musical motifs present in the original

>具有许多曲目 = feature many tracks

Heading up the music of 7 Remake is Masashi Hamauzu, who was first brought onto the Final Fantasy series for X to act **as a counterpart to** Nobuo Uematsu, **complimenting him with a more dreamy vibe in his compositions and arrangements**.
>充当...的作用 = as a counterpart to...

>通过他的作曲和编曲为其增添了更多梦幻的氛围，以补充他的音乐风格 = complimenting(增添, 补充) him with a more dreamy vibe(氛围) in his compositions and arrangements

Hamauzu would **take over Uematsu's position** when he left the company, and went on to be the **sole composer** for Final Fantasy XIII.
>接过了...的位置 = take over sb's position

>唯一作曲家 = sole composer

7 Remake also has a number of tracks written by Mitsuto Suzuki, who helped out on XIII's **two sequels**, as well as **up-and-coming guest composers and arrangers**, such as Octopath Traveler’s Yasunori Nishiki.
>两个续作 = two sequels

>崭露头角的客座作曲家, 编曲家 = up-and-coming composer and arranger(编曲家)

In this way, the music to Final Fantasy VII Remake feels **timeless**
>经久不衰 = timeless

**The collision of Uematsu's melodic craft with Hamauzu's dreamlike soundscapes is actually quite reminiscent of Final Fantasy X**, which along with VII **is considered to be** **a major leap forward in the series**.
>植松伸夫的旋律创作, 和浜渦正志的梦幻音乐的碰撞实际上相当令人回想起FF10 = The collision of Uematsu's melody craft with Hamauzu's dreamy soundscapes is actually quite reminiscent of Final Fantasy X.

>被认为是 = be considered to be

>整个系列的一次重大飞跃 = a major leap forward to the series

In once again bringing together these two composers’ distinct styles, 7 Remake nicely **bridges the gap** between the old and new sounds of Final Fantasy’s musical identity.
>弥合了...的空缺 = bridge the gap

The soundtrack of Final Fantasy 7 Remake is **a perfect little microcosm of the project’s philosophy at large**.
>该项目整体哲学的一个完美小缩影 = a perfect little microcosm of the project's philosophy at large(整体上)

It uses the original source material as a starting point, but fleshes out the story surrounding it and isn't afraid to throw in some **wacky new ideas**.
>古怪的新点子 = wacky new ideas

It mixes the old guard and classic elements with some fresh blood who are able to bring it into a modern step.

**But most of all**, it is a **loving ode** to Final Fantasy's history that **simultaneously sets a new precedent for the franchise moving forward**.
>但最重要的是 = but most of all

>深情颂歌 = loving ode

>同时为系列继续向前的发展设立了一个先例 = simultaneously sets a new precedent for the franchise moving forward

Just like the original, 7 Remake is once again a turning point for the series, and the best Final Fantasy game we’ve got in two decades.

I can't wait to see where it goes from here.
