### [In Defence of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's Soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TDN2qKjtck&t=10s)
(07:11 - end)

The silence of Breath of the Wild not only lends itself to the game’s emotional tone, but **serves functional purposes as well**.
>也服务于功能性的目的 = serve functional purposes as well

For one, it prevents the themes from getting repetitive and annoying across the dozens of hours you’ll spend **traversing Hyrule’s landscape**.
>横渡海拉鲁大陆的风景 = traversing Hyrule's landscape

It also allows the music to better elevate dramatic moments important to the story, such as Link’s memories revealed **along the way**, or the Divine Beast dungeons.
>在旅途中 = along the way

Sometimes though, these moments are much more subtle.

Storms are awful – you can’t climb, you can’t see, you can’t build a fire so no resting or cooking food, you risk being struck by lightning and you can’t use any metal items.

Worst of all, unless you’re in a specific area no music plays during a storm.

But when the sun finally breaks through the clouds and the **storm subsides**, the music will fade in to signal the return of safety.
>风暴平息 = storm subsides

 
Other times the music will start playing **for no apparent reason** at all, scoring a nothing moment like **chopping down a tree** or **scaling a cliff face**.
>没有明确原因 = for no apparent reason

>砍倒大树 = chopping down a tree

>爬悬崖峭壁 = scaling a cliff face

To me **this kind of harkens** back to those bigger moments, **turning something menial into something meaningful**.
>这些花心思的地方 = this kind of harkens

>让琐碎的小事意义非凡 = turning something menial(卑微的) into something meaningful

It’s a reminder that everything you do is important and working towards your greater goal of defeating Ganon and **restoring Hyrule to its former glory**.
>让海拉鲁恢复往日荣光 = restoring Hyrule to its former glory

Silence also enables the music to pull you closer to the world, making it feel smaller.

Kass might be a single bird, but you can hear his **accordion** in a area around him, drawing you towards him.
>手风琴 = accordion
>
>把你拉向他 = drawing you towards them

It’s the same with the **stables** or villages **peppered throughout the map** – **the slow fade-in of the music** guides you to them.
>马厩 = stable

>星罗棋布 = peppered throughout the map

>音乐的缓慢引入 = the slow fade-in of the music

Battles too, though this does sometimes have the opposite effect.

**This gentle tugging of the ear** can also be felt in the music’s recording.
>这种柔和的听觉体验 = this gentle tugging(拉扯) of the ear

**Following the precedent set with** Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild’s soundtrack is full of real, live-recorded instruments, **adding a nice physicality to the score**.
>...珠玉在前 = follow the precedent set with...(UT has a reputation precedes itself.)

>为乐曲引入了一种很嗨的实体感 = adding a nice physicality to the score

There’s a strong emphasis on solo performances, **creating an air of intimacy**, and the **timbre** of some of these instruments, such as the shakuhachi in the Kakariko Village theme, have a real **airy and organic texture**.
>创造了一种亲近感 = creating an air of intimacy

>音色 = timbre

>轻快且自然的质感 = airy and organic texture

If you listen carefully, you can sometimes even hear the performer breathing.

This pulls you closer to the music itself, **tuning your ear to its intricacies**.
>是你的耳朵感受到乐曲的错综复杂之处 = tuning your ear to its intricacies

It’s little touches like these that give Breath of the Wild’s score its intimate feeling.

All of this lends itself to an overarching feeling of sorrow.
>所有这些都导致了一种主题上的悲伤情感

The **contemplative space** found within the silence.
>静思的空间 = contemplative space

The **intimate and tender** instrument solos.
>亲切而温柔 = intimate and tender(嫩的, 温柔的)

The damaged piano tracks, an instrument which to me feels very **introspective and melancholic**.
>内省且忧郁 = introspective and melancholic

These three feelings – brokenness, intimacy and sorrow – when combined, they result in **burden**.
>责任 = burden

When you are deeply upset about something that is wrong, you **feel a personal weight of responsibility** to make it right.
>有一种使命感 = feel a personal weight of responsibility

This is **presumably** the burden that Link feels.
>大概 = presumably

100 years ago he was Princess Zelda’s knight in the fight against Ganon and he failed.

While many of Hyrule’s citizens are optimistic about Link’s return, others are angry and still blame him for what happened.

**I don’t think it’s too far-fetched to say** that our silent protagonist probably blames himself too and feels a little ashamed.
>我认为说...并不过分 = I don't think it's too far-fetched to say

We do see this much more clearly in Zelda.

It wasn’t so much Link’s responsibility to protect Hyrule as much as it was the Princess’s.

She was born with the burden of Hyrule placed on her shoulders and **dedicates her whole life trying to live up to this duty**, but is unable to achieve what is required of her.
>倾尽她的一生去完成这项使命 = dedicates her whole life to live up this duty

Zelda **is haunted by her past failures** and **resents her perceived inability** to protect Hyrule.
>被过去的失败所困扰 = be haunted(萦绕) with her past failures

>对自己的无能感到愧疚 = resents(感到愧疚) her perceived(察觉的) inability

To me, Breath of the Wild isn’t a game about having **lofty adventures** through a fantastic world – Link isn’t Bilbo Baggins leaving the Shire **for the sake of the adventure** and Zelda isn’t a **kidnapped** Princess in need of rescue; it’s a more personal tale of redemption, for Zelda, Link and Hyrule, **steeped in brokenness and failure**, but with just a touch of hope.
>崇高的冒险 = lofty adventure

>只为了冒险 = for the sake of the adventure

>被绑架的 = kidnapped

>充满破碎和失败 = steeped(浸泡, 使...充满) with brokenness and failure

The music **perfectly captures** this emotional core of the game, in a way that **catchy earworms** and **rousing, heroic fanfares** just can’t do.
>完美契合 = perfectly capture

>引人入胜的旋律 = catchy earworms

>激昂, 英勇的曲子 = rousing, heroic fanfares

Thank you to my Patreon family for actually making this video possible.

With their support I was able to purchase a **game capture card** and make this video that I’ve wanted to for months.
>游戏采集卡 = game capture card

**I am so incredibly grateful for the kindness that is extended to me**, it means so much.
