### [How Going Underwater Changed Game Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11PA8QlyRNI)
(start - 04:43)

Water levels **have a reputation for being a little inconsistent**.
>有着褒贬不一的 = have a reputation for being a little inconsistent

But one thing they almost always do well is their music.

Diving into the deep blue has birthed some of the greatest soundscapes in games, and some of the most **diverse** as well.
>多样化 = diverse

Water can create **such a vast range of** experiences and emotions.
>如此广泛的 = such a vast range of 

From **a joyful paddle at the beach**, to **the terrors lurking in the deep**.
>在海滩上愉快划水 = a joyful paddle at the beach

>深海中恐怖的潜伏 = the terrors lurking(潜伏) in the deep

Water can be refreshing, or you can drown in it.
>恢复精神的, 耳目一新的 = refreshing 

It can represent adventure, or a dead-end.

It can be **tranquil** and calming, or angry and frightening.
>平静的, 安静的 = tranquil

And it can be everything in between.

This allows composers to **draw from many different wells of inspiration** and **instil** their music with a wide variety of emotion.
>从许多不同的源头吸取灵感 = draw from many different wells of inspiration

>逐渐灌输 = instil

As a result, some of the best and most influential game tracks have come from under the sea.

That one’s **debatable**.
>有争议的 = debatable

In this episode of Game Score Fanfare, I’m going to take a look at how underwater music has evolved over the years, and consistently changed our perceptions of what game music can be.

Let’s dive in.

I’ll try and **keep** the water **puns** **to a minimum**, but no promises.
>把水的双关语控制到最小 = keep the water to a minimum

It’s hard to start anywhere else but the original water level from Super Mario Bros.

The Underwater theme was the first piece of music Koji Kondo composed for Super Mario Bros., and so it represents the birth of what was to become a turning point for games and their music.

Koji Kondo’s inspiration for the soundtrack came when seeing the little plumber in action – his fast, jumpy movement **called for** music that was exciting and energetic.
>需要 = call for

But when Mario goes for a swim, he’s no longer fast and **agile**, but slow and floaty, and the music matches.
>敏捷的 = agile

The pace is slower, notes are held for much longer, and they flow into one another much more smoothly.

But the biggest change was the **time signature**, moving from 4/4, the most common time signature, to 3/4, which is most often associated with the waltz.
>(乐谱)节拍 = time signature

It’s not hard to see the inspiration here when you compare the waltz to how Mario moves when he swims, with his bouncy upward **thrust** and slow gliding descent.
>猛推, 刺 = thrust

>缓慢滑翔下降 = slow gliding descent

This was, **more than likely**, the first ever video game piece not in common time, and it was really the first time game music **was considered outside of itself**.
>很有可能 = more than likely

>被看过超越自身范畴的 = be considered outside of itself

The underwater theme wasn’t just background **bleeps and bloops** in a computer game – it was a waltz.
>电子游戏的音效(俚语) = bleeps and bloops

Koji Kondo had placed an original piece of music from a game into the greater historical context of music, and **never before had it been thought about in that way**, at least not on **such a wide scale**.
>之前从来没有以这种方式被考虑过 = never before had been thought about in that way

>如此宽广的程度上 = such a wide scale

The main Overworld theme might have more pop culture reach, but I’d argue that the Underwater theme did much more for **legitimising game music**.
>正统游戏音乐 = legitimising game music

Super Mario Bros. also established a number of tropes associated with water levels and their music.
>文艺作品中常见的元素或主题 = trope

Sluggish controls became the default underwater mechanic, so there was lots of slow-paced, smooth music going around.
>迟钝的控制 = sluggish control

The waltz style was mostly left to Mario, but there was one aspect of it that **caught on**.
>开始变得流行起来 = catch on

Koji Kondo slightly altered the traditional waltz rhythm by moving the third note up to create this rising note pattern, which resembles an **arpeggio**: when notes in a chord are played in an ascending or descending order.
>琶音 = arpeggio

Arpeggios are used all the time in underwater music: an ascending arpeggio can **bring to mind** bubbles rising to the surface.
>让人联想到 = bring to mind

Combine it with a descending arpeggio and you get this wave-like pattern that feels like you’re floating in the ocean.

And even just downward motion – Ocarina of Time’s water temple has a series of descending arpeggios, which makes sense when you consider that dungeon involves equipping the heavy iron boots and sinking to the bottom like an **anchor**.
>锚 = anchor

Koji Kondo’s influence was everywhere, and **it took someone who was a little bit removed to shake things up**.
>需要有一些有点不相关的人来改变现状 = it took someone who was a little bit removed to shake things up
