### [How Octopath Traveler Hypes its Boss Battles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7Zc3f8cPnU)
(04:40 - end)

The entire sequence is made up of three parts - the first is the pre-battle track, For Redemption.

This is a 25-second long track that will continuously loop either forever, or until you press the A button and enter the battle, whichever comes first.

When that happens, the track will immediately cut on the next beat to **a short transitionary cue**, which seamlessly connects the end of the lead-in track with the beginning of the boss track.
>一个短暂的过度有提示音 = a short transitionary cue(过度音, 提示音)

Where it gets more complicated is in the actual music.

Because this transition can happen at any point during the 25-second loop, For Redemption needs **account for** this in its composition, and as a result is quite different to anything else found on Octopath’s soundtrack.
>考虑到 = account for

Unlike the rest of the score, the melody **takes a bit of back-seat** here - you can’t just use Olberic’s Theme in this scene because the melody would get cut short, **leaving it unresolved** and breaking the momentum in the process.
>有点略显次要 = take a bit of back-seat

>导致它未完成 = leaving it unsolved

Olberic’s theme is instead **hinted at** through use of the horns, **albeit** in **a much more textural way** that allows them **to be suddenly interrupted with minimal impact**.
>暗示 = hint at

>尽管 = albeit

>更多以纹理的方式 = a much more textural way

>在影响最小的情况下突然中断 = to be suddenly interrupted with minimal impact

The same goes for the key of the piece.
>key在这里指的是音调

As 8-Bit Music Theory discussed in his video, Olberic’s Theme changes its key from D-minor to F-minor in order to spice things up a little.
>使事情更有趣 = spice things up a little

However the looping section of For Redemption is limited to staying in D-minor so that it can smoothly jump into the transition cue at any moment.

The transition’s purpose is to somehow find its way from D-minor to the opening key of the boss track, G-minor, which it does by the way of **A-flat-major**.
>降A大调 = A-falt-major

One final consideration to make is the tempo.

The boss theme is set to a **brisk** 164 beats per minute, so in order to maintain the momentum through the transition, For Redemption needs to be locked to this same tempo as well.
>欢快的 = brisk

But Olberic is only one of the playable characters in Octopath Traveler and Redemption is his goal.

All eight characters have their own stories, goals, bosses to face and music that plays in the lead-up to them.

So actually it’s not just one track into one other, but rather 8 tracks that all perfectly build into the **Decisive Battle**.
>决定性的战斗 = decisive battle

Each one was written not only to capture the spirit of the character but all exist within the same limitations: a melody that can at any point **immediately pivot to a new section**, being locked to a specific tempo and remain in a single key.
>立刻转向一个新部分 = immediately pivot to a new section

But what makes this even more impressive is that there’s a second boss track.

And in Chapter 4 there’s a third, and they all manage to be just as seamless in their transition.

This is because these boss tracks also stick to the same limitations as the first: They’re set to 164 bpm and start in G-minor in order to make it work.

On top of this, there are optional boss battles that give you the hidden job classes and these also have a unique boss theme that sticks to these same limitations, despite not even doing the transition in-game.

But it still works!

So that’s eight different character tracks, all of which build perfectly and transition smoothly into four different boss themes at whatever point the player chooses.

That is madness.

But, it’s evidence of the **level of care** that went into the game and its score.
>关注程度 = level of care

Octopath Traveler is one of my favourite games of 2018 because you can feel the developers’ passion for the project and love for the classic JRPGs and soundtracks that inspired them.

But it’s not just a **rehash** of everything that’s come before to **capitalize on** nostalgia - they let inspiration in from other aspects of life, as so many of the great game designers of the past have.
>重讲 = rehash

>充分利用 = capitalize on 

They were willing to try ambitious new things to bring that same experience to a new generation.

Thanks for watching!

Be sure to watch 8-Bit Music Theory’s deep dive on Octopath’s use of key changes, his videos have taught me literally everything I know about the composition of video game music.

If you’ve just come from there, then hi!

Feel free to check out my other Octopath video exploring how Nishiki made **retro game** music with an orchestra.
