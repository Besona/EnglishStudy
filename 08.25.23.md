### [How the song "Undertale" Hits Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xR-xOkKP44&t=112s)
(06:05 - end)

**Being unshackled to the limitations of these older consoles** means Undertale can also use some modern, better sounding samples such as the piano in Snowy and the acoustic guitar in Home.
>摆脱这些老效果器的枷锁 = being unshackled to the limitations of these older consoles

But these are still very obviously digital instruments and **stay in line with** the soundtrack’s established tone.
>与...一致 = stay in line with

Maintaining a consistent tone is a great way to create **immersion**, so by keeping the music consistent and to a certain extent serious, it allows Undertale to run a little wild without breaking the player’s immersion.
>沉浸 = immersion

Arriving at New Home then is a series of breaking that tone and immersion in order to reveal the game’s heart.

Just seeing Toriel’s house again is enough to remove the player from the moment and think back to the beginning of the game.

And instead of the digital guitar sample in Home, there’s now a real acoustic guitar being played by a real human being: Stephanie MacIntire **in this case**.
>在这里 = in this case

This is the only live recording of an instrument on Undertale’s entire soundtrack and it takes the game’s absurd, fanciful tone and **brings it hurtling back down to Earth**.
>带回地面 = bring it hurtling back down to the Earth

When all you’ve heard in the entire game is digital, an actual instrument stands out as something organic.

The scene’s humanity is emphasised by the subtleties possible in a human performance: the tiny imperfections in timing, the guitar being slightly out of tune, the sound of the pick on the strings.
>这一幕中"人性"被人的演奏中的一些微妙的东西强化了: 微小的不合拍, 吉他稍微跑调, 以及拨弦的声音

These human elements all help to create a personal atmosphere and **ground the scene in the real-world to bring out its emotional punch**.
>把场景带回现实, 并带来情感冲击 = ground the scene in the real-world to bring out its emotional punch

New Home is the point that Undertale has been building towards: It’s when you finally understand the monsters’ true motives and desires, and you begin to feel compassion for them.

But it’s far from a happy, harmonious moment as you’re about to meet the big baddie Asgore, who wants to use your Human soul to break the spell trapping the monsters underground.

When Toby Fox first wrote the music for this scene, it sounded quite different.

This version feels sad and **mournful**, with a heavy bass and some really dark chords.
>悲哀的 = mournful

Compare that to what was eventually used in-game, which to me feels almost hopeful: a positive mindset moving forward.

**Positivity in the song’s major key**, giving it a more optimistic tone.
>打掉中的乐观性 = positivity in the song's major key

And forward momentum through its **steady beat** and heavy use of **predominant chords**.
>稳定的节拍 = steady beats

>主和弦 = predominant chords

Check out Ongaku Concept’s video on Hopes and Dreams if you want to know the music theory behind that.

But this scene at New Home isn’t hopeful at all.

It’s the opposite: you’re a dead man walking, about to meet your **executioner**.
>处决者 = executioner

Surely the sad and mournful piece of music would be more appropriate for **scoring the player’s emotion**.
>刻画玩家的情感 = scoring the player's emotion

Well that’s true, but it’s not the point of this scene.

It’s not about the player or the protagonist’s emotions – it’s about the monsters.

They’re excited and happy because they’re about to be set free.

They’re hopeful in their King’s promise that your arrival will finally mean the end of their suffering.

The music is scoring the monster’s emotion **rather than** your own, and this forces a **change in your perspective**, allowing you to feel how they do.
>而非 = rather than

>转变你的观念 = change in your perspective

And that’s empathy.

That’s what Undertale is all about: understanding and sharing in the feelings of others, even if you’re **at odds with them**.
>与他们不同 = at odd with them

Toby Fox understands that music is a powerful way of **conveying emotion**, but instead of using it to draw out what the player should already be feeling (**assuming** the writing is doing its job), he uses it to make us feel how the other side does.
>传达情感 = conveying emotions

>假设 = assuming

A sense of safety, and humanity, and hope.

It would be so easy for this moment to come across as **clichéd**, or **contrived** or **saccharine**, but it just doesn’t thanks to the music.
>GSF装b时刻

>陈词滥调的 = clichéd

>不自然的, 勉强的 = contrived

>故作多情的, 甜得发腻的 = saccharine

It totally hits home.
