### [The Best Games from GMTK Game Jam 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxZ_LOlFnU&t=8s)
(08:02 - 11:34)

**Another popular approach for this theme** was to take a well-known game, and completely **flip it on its head**.
>Another popular approach for this theme = Another popular take on this idea

>倒转过来 = flip it on its head

So, Inside Job is an upside-down tower defence game where you place down the minions, **rather than** the towers.
>而不是 = rather than

You've got **a bunch of** different **baddies** to pick from - each on different cooldowns - and you have to carefully **deploy** them to overwhelm the opponent's defences.
>一批 = a bunch of

>坏蛋 = baddie

>部署 = deploy

Sometimes that means making sure many enemies arrive at the towers **simultaneously**, so some **slip by unharmed**.
>同时 = simultaneously

>毫发无损地通过 = slip by unharmed

Or using a **costly power-up** to temporarily shut down the defences.
>昂贵的强化道具 = costly power-ups

**Bonus points** to Tower Attack, which also **toyed with** the "tower offence" concept.
>额外加分 = bonus points

>玩弄 = toy with

Another **genre** that's **ripe for reversal** is the **stealth game**.
>类别 = genre = category(synonym)

>适合*反转*(对于*反转*来说很成熟) = ripe for reversal

>潜行游戏 = stealth game

In Sneakerdoodle, we actually want to **be spotted by patrolling guards**.
>被巡逻的守卫看到 = be spotted by patrolling guards

You play as an **attention-hungry** **pooch** who wants to be chased by humans.
>渴望关注 = attention-hungry

>杂种狗 = pooch

But not caught and **cuddled**.
>抱住 = cuddle

So you need to **intentionally** trip these wandering **view-cones**...and then make a dash for it before you're actually caught.
>故意地 = intentionally

>视锥 = view-cone

This leads to some surprisingly clever levels as you **dart** under tables, **squeeze through tight gaps**, and carefully choose the order in which you get spotted, so **you don't find yourself trapped**.
>猛冲 = dart = barge

>从夹缝中挤过去 = squeeze through tight gaps

>你不会被困住 = you don't find yourself be trapped

**Retro games** also **provided a good opportunity for** role reversal.
>复古游戏 = retro games

>给了...一个好机会 = provide a good opportunity for

In Bricker Breaks Free, the game starts with a very familiar **set-up**: a **paddle** firing a ball towards a bundle of blocks.
>设定 = set-up

>板子 = paddle

But then things change: the camera swaps into an **isometric view** and you're now controlling the entire field of blocks as a single, **amorphous character**.
>等轴测视图 = isometric view

>无定形的角色 = amorphous character

Now you're **moving through corridors** of enemy paddles and wandering balls.
>在走廊中穿梭 = moving through corridors

You can shoot at the paddles to destroy them, but this actually uses your blocks as **ammo** - making you a tiny bit smaller with every shot you take.
>子弹 = ammo = ammunition

And the smaller you get, the more vulnerable your core becomes.

However, **it's not all bad being small** - you can use your **slimmed-down structure** to **sneak through tight gaps**.
>变小也并非一无是处 = it's not all bad being small

>修长的结构 = slimmed-down structure

>从狭缝中溜过 = sneak through tight gaps = squeeze through tight gaps

This is a fun, **frantic**, and very clever twist on an **arcade favourite**.
>疯狂的扭曲 = frantic twist

>经典街机游戏 = arcade favorite

I just love games that use the character's shifting size and shape to organically change the way you play the game.
>我真的喜欢那些利用角色不断变化的大小和形状来有机地改变你玩游戏方式的游戏。(整句翻译)

Kinda like... Snake, which actually inspired two games in the top 100.

**My favourite, though**, was VERSUS SNAKE, which turns the **sedate Nokia phone favourite** into a **legitimately scary first-person horror game**.
>然而我最喜欢的是 = My favorite, though

>沉静的诺基亚游戏 = sedate Nokia game

>真正恐怖的第一人称游戏 = legitimately scary first-person horror game

So you need to find all the apples in the room and feed them to the snake.

Or you can throw them far away from you to **distract the giant cobra** and give yourself a chance to get away.
>分散那只巨大的眼镜蛇的注意力 = distract the giant cobra

It plays on the familiar **AI patterns** of the original game, but turns it into something completely fresh.
>人工智能模式 = AI patterns

Real-world games were also **at the mercy of** our clever game jammers.
>受到...的影响 = at the mercy of

Descriptionary is a really **imaginative rethink** of Pictionary.
>富有想象力的重构 = imaginative rethink

Basically, the character tells you what to draw - just squares, lines, **arches**, and circles, with **vague directions** for where they should go.
>拱形 = arch

>模糊的指导 = vague direction

You can then **doodle** that in the box below.
>涂鸦 = doodle

Your job is to guess what you've just drawn.

It's a bit like translating the same message through 4 languages on Google Translate - you know, **things start getting a bit wonky**, but you can still figure out the **original intent**.
>事情开始稍微变得有点怪 = things start getting a bit wonky

>原始意图 = original intent

This game is **super polished** and well worth a play.
>被好好打磨过 = super-polished

I also want to **give props to** The Last Piece Standing, for being a rare chess-based game that I actually enjoy.
>表扬 = give props to

You play as the king, and have to destroy a bunch of enemy pieces that are slowly marching towards your army.

However, you can borrow the powers of the other pieces to make **massive jumps** and **diagonal leaps** across the board.
>大跳 = massive jump

>斜线走法 = diagonal leap

This **turns each bout into** a careful positioning puzzle.
>把每回合都变成了... = turn each bout into a 

Good stuff.

Another way to interpret the theme was to look at the different roles in games and relationships, and let us take the side that we don't usually get to play.

Take, for instance, Get Packing where we become the shopkeeper NPC from your typical RPG.
>以《Get Packing》为例，我们成为了典型角色扮演游戏中的店主 NPC。(整句翻译)

In each round you have a limited amount of money to spend on the weapons, shields, food, and potions, brought in by the 
brave and **copyright-dodging adventurer**.
>躲避版权问题的冒险者 = copyright-dodging adventurer

You then **flip to the store room** where you embrace your inner Leon S. Kennedy and **try to squish all this stuff into the cramped confines of a crate**.
>切换到储藏室 = flip to the store room

>试图把所有这些东西塞进狭小的箱子里 = try to squish(挤扁) all this stuff into the cramped(狭小的) confines(限制) of a crate(板条箱).

What's more, certain items can affect their surroundings - so don't put a magic flame sword next to your bananas, because the fruit will go bad.

Sure, we have seen games about being a shopkeeper, but this was still a cute game, and is worth checking out.








Another game to do this was Crabjuice.

It's clearly inspired by the horrible **headcrabs** from the Half-Life games - those **mutant chicken nuggets** who **pounce on your face**.
>Headcrab is a imaginary creature initially appeared in Half Life

>突变的鸡块 = mutant chicken nugget

>弹你脸上 = pounce on your face

But here, it's used to make a excellent puzzle game.

Playing as the headcrab, you have to get around these **cramped levels** by leaping from one human's face to another.
>狭窄的关卡 = cramped level

Soon you'll be flinging yourself into switches to open doors, narrowly avoiding enemies with guns, and **ricocheting yourself off walls** for a **better vantage point**.
>把自己扔到开关上 = flinging yourself into switch (fling这个词应该有印象)

>把你自己从墙壁上反弹 = ricocheting yourself off walls

>更好的视角 = better vantage point

Pets and Pokemon were also common targets for role reversal.

We're so used to playing as the human that we don't stop to think what it's like to be the animal.

Not so in Walkies - a game where you play as a **bone-hungry** dog, who is **cruelly constrained** by a **tight leash** and a strong owner.
>渴望骨头的 = bone-hungry(之前有一个attention hungry)

>严格限制的 = cruelly constrained

>牢固的绳子 = tight leash

So the owner wanders around the town automatically, giving you a small **radius** to explore for bones.
>半径 = radius

And also ways to gain power - you can get pets from passing humans, say, or use **fire hydrants** as a **handy toilet**.
>消防栓 = fire hydrant

>趁手的厕所 = handy toilet

Once you're powered up completely, the **screen zooms out** and now the dog is totally in charge.
>屏幕放大 = screen zoom out

You can zoom around at double speed and the human is powerless to stop you.

It's a fun **back and forth** of power and powerlessness.
>来来回回 = back and forth

Meanwhile, in One Day Better, you play as a cat who tries to help its **depressed human**.
>抑郁人类 = depressed human

The dude wakes up in a **funk** - a fuzzy fog of thoughts clouding their mind.
>恐惧 = funk

**Left to their own devices** they'd happily sleep in all day.
>任由其发展 = left to their own devices

But their **faithful moggy** can use a few tools to get them going.
>有信念的猫猫 = faithful moggy

So you can meow to get the human's attention.

Scratch at stuff to make them move towards objects.

And even **headbutt** the human's legs to get them to move between rooms.
>头槌 = headbutt

Using these three commands you can make your owner tidy their room, have a shower, and eat breakfast.

It's a **heartfelt and touching** little game about the **restorative power of animals**, and I really liked it.
>衷心且动人 = heartfelt and touching

>来自动物的恢复力 = restorative power of animals

Another take on the theme was to give you a pretty standard game.

and then **pull the rug from beneath your feet** by reversing the roles.
>出其不意 = pull the rug from beneath your feet

Take UVSU.

It's a **platformer** where you have to get the angel to the goal before time runs out.
>平台跳跃 = platformer

Seems simple enough? But then you replay the level, but now as an **imp** who has to kill the angel before they reach the door. 
>小鬼 = imp

And then you play it AGAIN, but as another angel who now has to reach the door while **dodging the imp and its bullets**.
>躲避小鬼和其子弹 = dodging the inp and its bullets(dodging出现过, copyright dodging protagonist)

Hopefully that made some sense.

Basically, you're **simultaneously killing and dodging yourself** and must **think several steps ahead** so you don't **screw yourself over** in future runs. 
>同时消灭和躲避自己 = simultaneously killing and dodging yourself

>提前思考数步 = think several steps ahead

>坏了自己的事 = screw yourself over

I think you just need to play this to really get it.

It's a wonderfully clever game.

Not surprising, when you learn that it was made by the developer behind Toodee and Topdee - which also **started life as a game jam game**.
>起初是一款game jam游戏 = start life as a game jam game

Reversal Rooms also begins as a basic platformer.

But then, in level two, your jump button actually controls the **spikes**.
>尖刺 = spike

Then you control the **spring**.
>弹簧 = spring

And then the door.

It's a **manic context-switching headscratcher** that basically feels like Wario Ware as a platformer, and **I really dig it**.
>疯狂的上下文切换难题 = manic context-switching headscratcher

>我真的很喜欢它 = I really dig it

And then Ragdolf looks like your average **putting simulator** - but then this happens.
>高尔夫模拟器 = putting simulator

Oops.

**Turns out** you need to use the ball as a bounce pad to get you around the level.
>事实证明 = turns out

It's actually way more than a slapstick sight gag, though: it quickly turns into a tricky platformer where you must carefully time your swings for the correct power and angle.
>然而，实际上远不止是一种闹剧式的视觉笑话：它迅速演变成了一个棘手的平台游戏，在这个游戏中，你必须仔细掌握摆动的时机，以获得正确的力量和角度。(整句翻译)

I played through this entire game with a big smile on my face.

Highly recommend this one.
