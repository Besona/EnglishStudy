### [The Best Games from GMTK Game Jam 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxZ_LOlFnU&t=8s)
(08:05 - 11:34)

Another game to do this was Crabjuice.

It's clearly inspired by the horrible **headcrabs** from the Half-Life games - those **mutant chicken nuggets** who **pounce on your face**.
>Headcrab is a imaginary creature initially appeared in Half Life

>突变的鸡块 = mutant chicken nugget

>弹你脸上 = pounce on your face

But here, it's used to make a excellent puzzle game.

Playing as the headcrab, you have to get around these **cramped levels** by leaping from one human's face to another.
>狭窄的关卡 = cramped level

Soon you'll be flinging yourself into switches to open doors, narrowly avoiding enemies with guns, and **ricocheting yourself off walls** for a **better vantage point**.
>把自己扔到开关上 = flinging yourself into switch (fling这个词应该有印象)

>把你自己从墙壁上反弹 = ricocheting yourself off walls

>更好的视角 = better vantage point

Pets and Pokemon were also common targets for role reversal.

We're so used to playing as the human that we don't stop to think what it's like to be the animal.

Not so in Walkies - a game where you play as a **bone-hungry** dog, who is **cruelly constrained** by a **tight leash** and a strong owner.
>渴望骨头的 = bone-hungry(之前有一个attention hungry)

>严格限制的 = cruelly constrained

>牢固的绳子 = tight leash

So the owner wanders around the town automatically, giving you a small **radius** to explore for bones.
>半径 = radius

And also ways to gain power - you can get pets from passing humans, say, or use **fire hydrants** as a **handy toilet**.
>消防栓 = fire hydrant

>趁手的厕所 = handy toilet

Once you're powered up completely, the **screen zooms out** and now the dog is totally in charge.
>屏幕放大 = screen zoom out

You can zoom around at double speed and the human is powerless to stop you.

It's a fun **back and forth** of power and powerlessness.
>来来回回 = back and forth

Meanwhile, in One Day Better, you play as a cat who tries to help its **depressed human**.
>抑郁人类 = depressed human

The dude wakes up in a **funk** - a fuzzy fog of thoughts clouding their mind.
>恐惧 = funk

**Left to their own devices** they'd happily sleep in all day.
>任由其发展 = left to their own devices

But their **faithful moggy** can use a few tools to get them going.
>有信念的猫猫 = faithful moggy

So you can meow to get the human's attention.

Scratch at stuff to make them move towards objects.

And even **headbutt** the human's legs to get them to move between rooms.
>头槌 = headbutt

Using these three commands you can make your owner tidy their room, have a shower, and eat breakfast.

It's a **heartfelt and touching** little game about the **restorative power of animals**, and I really liked it.
>衷心且动人 = heartfelt and touching

>来自动物的恢复力 = restorative power of animals

Another take on the theme was to give you a pretty standard game.

and then **pull the rug from beneath your feet** by reversing the roles.
>出其不意 = pull the rug from beneath your feet

Take UVSU.

It's a **platformer** where you have to get the angel to the goal before time runs out.
>平台跳跃 = platformer

Seems simple enough? But then you replay the level, but now as an **imp** who has to kill the angel before they reach the door. 
>小鬼 = imp

And then you play it AGAIN, but as another angel who now has to reach the door while **dodging the imp and its bullets**.
>躲避小鬼和其子弹 = dodging the inp and its bullets(dodging出现过, copyright dodging protagonist)

Hopefully that made some sense.

Basically, you're **simultaneously killing and dodging yourself** and must **think several steps ahead** so you don't **screw yourself over** in future runs. 
>同时消灭和躲避自己 = simultaneously killing and dodging yourself

>提前思考数步 = think several steps ahead

>坏了自己的事 = screw yourself over

I think you just need to play this to really get it.

It's a wonderfully clever game.

Not surprising, when you learn that it was made by the developer behind Toodee and Topdee - which also **started life as a game jam game**.
>起初是一款game jam游戏 = start life as a game jam game

Reversal Rooms also begins as a basic platformer.

But then, in level two, your jump button actually controls the **spikes**.
>尖刺 = spike

Then you control the **spring**.
>弹簧 = spring

And then the door.

It's a **manic context-switching headscratcher** that basically feels like Wario Ware as a platformer, and **I really dig it**.
>疯狂的上下文切换难题 = manic context-switching headscratcher

>我真的很喜欢它 = I really dig it

And then Ragdolf looks like your average **putting simulator** - but then this happens.
>高尔夫模拟器 = putting simulator

Oops.

**Turns out** you need to use the ball as a bounce pad to get you around the level.
>事实证明 = turns out

It's actually way more than a slapstick sight gag, though: it quickly turns into a tricky platformer where you must carefully time your swings for the correct power and angle.
>然而，实际上远不止是一种闹剧式的视觉笑话：它迅速演变成了一个棘手的平台游戏，在这个游戏中，你必须仔细掌握摆动的时机，以获得正确的力量和角度。(整句翻译)

I played through this entire game with a big smile on my face.

Highly recommend this one.
