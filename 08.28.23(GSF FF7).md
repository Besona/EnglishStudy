### [How Final Fantasy VII Remade its Soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59c3xz76M80)
(begin - 05:03)

The Final Fantasy VII Remake is **unprecedented**.
>先例 = precedent, 前所未有的 = unprecedented

While we’ve recently seen a number of games **being rebuilt from the ground up**, **offering a modern update to an aging classic**, none of them **come close to the scope or ambition of 7 Remake**.
>从头开始重建 = being rebuilt from ground up

>为经典老游戏提供现代化更新 = offering a modern update to an aging classic

>与FF7RE的范围和野心相提并论 = come close to the scope or ambition of 7 Remake

The city of Midgar, originally a 3-5 hour **prologue** to Final Fantasy VII, **has been transformed into a fully-fledged 30-50 hour standalone experience**.
>序章 = prologue

>已经被改编成一个完整的, 30-50小时的独立体验 = has been transformed into a fully-fledged(羽毛丰满的, 成熟的) 30-50 hours standalone(独立的) experience.

And it’s **utterly deserving** - **Midgar is a fascinating dystopian city**, and **spending only a few hours there never did it justice**.
>完全值得 = utterly deserving

>米德加是一个迷人的反乌托邦城市 = Midgar is a fascinating dystopian city

>只逛几小时无法领略其魅力(做出公正评价) = spending only a few hours there never did it justice

The themes Midgar represents of human environmental destruction and late-stage corporate capitalism are more relevant in 2020 than they ever were back in 1997.
>米德加尔所代表的人类环境破坏和晚期企业资本主义的主题, 在2020年比1997年更加相关(整句翻译)

But humanity’s perpetual descent into an ecological apocalypse at the hand of unmitigated capitalist gain is not the only thing that’s changed in the past two decades - video games have also changed.
>然而，人类不断陷入生态末日的境地，这一切都是由于无节制的资本主义获益所致，并不是过去两十年里发生变化的唯一事情 - 视频游戏也发生了变化。

>不断地 = perpetual

>陷入 = descent into

>环境末日 =  ecological apocalypse

>由于 = at the hand of

>资本主义的无节制索取 = unmitigated(未缓和的, 完全的) capitalist gain

The technical restrictions faced in the 90’s **have been all but eliminated**, allowing the game to tell its story **with so much more grace and nuance**.
>已经全部被消除 = have been all but eliminated

>有着更多的优雅和细微差别 = with so much more grace and nuance(细微差别)

And just one of the ways it achieves this is through its music.

Remake is an entirely different game to Final Fantasy VII, and thus it **requires an entirely different approach to its soundtrack**.
>需要一种完全不同的配乐方式 = requires an entirely different approach to its soundtrack

Square-Enix **embraced this opportunity to deepen the musical storytelling of the game**, with new arrangements of old tracks, **new tracks featuring old motifs**, and rethinking how music **is implemented** into the game.
>抓住了这个机会来深化了游戏的音乐叙事 = embrace this opportunity to deepen the musical storytelling of the game

>旧主题的新曲目 = new tracks featuring ole motifs

>被融入 = be implemented

It **presents** us with a unique opportunity to explore **how the role of video game music has evolved over the past 20 years**.
>这呈现给我们一个独特的机会来探索在过去20年中视频游戏配乐的角色是如何发展的(整句翻译)

So this is how Final Fantasy VII remake its soundtrack for the modern era.

The most obvious change between the two games’ soundtracks is its **audio fidelity**.
>音频保真度 = audio fidelity

Although the PS1 could offer CD-quality audio **on par with** modern recordings, Final Fantasy VII’s soundtrack was instead created using the Playstation’s internal sound chip.
>与...相媲美 = on par with

Even though CD-quality audio was technically possible, it takes up a lot of space on those CDs, which was needed for other things such as the game.

CD-quality audio just wasn’t **feasible** for a game of FF7's size, which was already **stretched across 3 discs**.
>可行的 = feasible

>占据了三张光盘 = be stretched across 3 discs

This is not such a problem in 2020.

**Aside from** modern digital instrument samples sounding pretty authentic now, **consoles** come installed with **massive hard drives** which have minimized the limitations due to storage, and audio fills a **comparatively** much smaller space in a game when it looks like this.
>除了 = aside from

>console可以翻译为游戏机

>大硬盘 = massive hard drives

>相对来说 = comparatively

Remake embraces the symphonic sound that the original could only suggest, with fully orchestrated performances of the classic tunes.
>重制版采用原版只能想想的交响乐声音, 充斥着管线乐版本的经典旋律 

However not every track from Final Fantasy VII aimed for the orchestra.

Many **leaned into** the **electronica palette**, such as the **grimy** bass-driven theme of the slums, Underneath the Rotting Pizza.
>引起,导致(采用) = lean into

>电子风格(调色) = electronica palette

>脏的, 污秽的 = grimy

>slum = 贫民窟

And of course there is Uematsu’s love for **progressive rock** which **underpinned** the battle and boss themes.
>植松 = Uematsu

>渐进摇滚 = progressive rock

>巩固 = underpin

These tracks are all given the Remake treatment with appropriate arrangements that realise the intention of the original.

While the Remake enables **faithful adaptations** of the original’s tunes, it also allows for some more... **creative interpretations**.
>忠实改编 = faithful adaptation

>创意性的诠释 = creative interpretation

From **a dub reggae remix** of the track The Oppressed, to… whatever Hip Hop de Chocobo is?
>有配音的雷鬼remix = a dub reggae remix

These more **liberal arrangements** are put to great effect with some of the game’s **recurring motifs**.
>自由的改编 = liberal arrangements

>反复出现的主题 = recurring motif

The first time we see Tifa in the Remake, we get a **faithful, orchestral rendition** of her original theme.
>忠实的, 管弦乐版的演出 = faithful, orchestral rendition

It feels familiar and comforting, you **swell up with love** when you see her and hear the music again after all these years - potentially similar to how Cloud feels having his childhood friend around once again.
>因爱感动/充满爱意 = swell up with love

Not long after **we are treated to a cozy lounge rendition of Tifa's theme**, when she mixes a drink for Cloud at her bar and they have a little chat.
>我们享受到了一个温馨旅馆版本的蒂法主题曲 = we're treated with a cozy lounge rendition of Tifa's theme

This version is more representative of Tifa in her job as **bartender** of Seventh Heaven - you can almost **picture a quartet in the corner of the room** playing the song.
>酒保 = bartender

>想想房间的角落有一个四重奏 = picture a quartet in the corner of the room

Finally, much later, we get a high energy **EDM** version of her theme, when Tifa and Aerith **beat up the perverts**.
>EDM = Electronic Dance Music

>制止坏人 = beat up perverts

These additional arrangements of Tifa's Theme aren't as faithful to the original, but they help to **flesh out her character** and score the different situations she finds herself in.
>让她的角色更加立体 = flesh out her character

Tifa of course is not the only character to be given this treatment, in fact the use of her leitmotif is rather simple.

In particular, there are a ton of variations on the Shinra theme.

Though a number of these instances are actually variations on the main battle theme, titled “Let The Battles Begin!”, which features the Shinra motif as a constant reminder of who the enemy is and what you’re fighting for.

This battle theme however isn't actually used in the same way as it was in the original, because combat in the Remake has been completely **overhauled**.
>彻底检查, 大修 = overhaul

There are no random encounters in 7 Remake, and entering combat doesn’t transport you to a **separate screen**; it’s all integrated within the field.
>分离的界面 = separate screen

This is something Square have been trying to do since Final Fantasy XII, but **they’ve struggled to make it work**.
>他们一直难以使其成功 = they've struggled to make it work

In XII there was no battle screen transition, and no change in the music to even establish the fact you’re in combat.

XIII’s encounters weren’t random, but still sent you to a **discrete battle sequence** for combat, with its own theme that often got cut off as soon as it was beginning to **ramp up**.
>独立的战斗场景(序列) = discrete battle sequence

>升温(上升) = ramp up(筹资那集遇见过)

And XV returned to having no screen transition, but **cued in a battle track** anyway, and the result was a little jarring.
>播放战斗音乐 = cue(提示, 暗示, 线索) in battle track

>刺耳的, 不和谐的 = jarring

But in 7 Remake **they have finally managed to find a way that flows naturally by forgoing a traditional battle theme**, but **dynamically introducing extra elements into the area theme during combat**.
>他们终于成功地找到了一种自然流畅的方式，放弃了传统的战斗音乐(主题) = they have finally managed to find a way that flows naturally by forgoing a traditional battle theme

>在战斗期间动态地引入了额外的元素到区域音乐(主题) = dynamically introducing extra elements into the area theme during combat

I won’t get into this too much, as there is already an excellent video by 8-Bit Music Theory discussing how they achieved this with the Mako Reactor theme.

But essentially, the intensity of these usually rather chill area themes is ramped up in real-time by fading in more layers of instrumentation whenever combat is initiated.
>但是从本质上来讲, 每当战斗开始时, 这些通常相当轻松的区域主题会通过淡入更多的乐器层次来实时提高强度(整句翻译)

7 Remake is **certainly not** the first game to do this, in fact it’s become quite **commonplace**, but it’s just one of the ways that Final Fantasy finally feels modern again.
>无疑不是 = certainly not

>老生常谈的 = commonplace

### Others 
广受好评的视频作者 = critically(表程度) acclaimed(受到好评) video creator
Take Tifa, for example.

In the original game, Tifa gets her own theme.

But that's it - apart from a quick reference in the ending movement, this is the exact piece of music that plays pretty much every time there’s an important Tifa scene.
