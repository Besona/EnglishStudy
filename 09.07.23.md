### [Scoring Ori's Ginso Tree Escape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTT3piMjqmM)
(04:36 - end)

It’s brutal but rewarding, and **music-wise** it’s actually similar to an on-rails section except you still get to have full control over Ori’s movement.
>从音乐的角度看 = music-wise

The level is designed to limit you to a certain pace and as a result, the music is able to very precisely score the action happening, without limiting interactivity.

So first, a minimum pace is set **in the form of** the rising water.
>以...的形式 = in the form of

If the water catches you, it’s back to the start.

With the threat of death continuously on your tail, there’s no time to stop and explore or enjoy the scenery; it forces you forward.

Plus the track opening with these **frantic strings** and rapid drum beats tells you “This is serious, you need get moving.”
>激烈的音乐 = frantic strings

Then there is a speed limit introduced, with some tricks in the level to prevent you from getting too far ahead.

Certain sections have you bashing off timed projectiles, so unless you’re so quick as to catch the one before, you’re gonna have to wait for the next one, bringing you back into pace.

There’s also the **glowing, enticing** bonus experience points **conspicuously** placed in **out-of-the-way** locations along the run, **luring away** the faster players who **have** a few extra seconds **in their pocket**.
>发光的, 诱人的 = glowing, enticing

>明显地 = conspicuously

>偏僻位置 = out-of-the-way

>诱使 = lure away   

>有...在口袋里(其实就是有...) = have ... in their pocket

What this all achieves is keeping the player moving at a certain pace without actually putting them on **cruise-control**, and ultimately, this serves to enable a smooth transition into the cutscene at the end.
>定速巡航 = cruise-control

While the track does loop, a run through the Ginso Tree is timed to be about the same length as a single loop, so the entire level is designed to make that transition as seamless as possible.

But pacing the player like this also allows the music to feel responsive to their actions and the world, even though it’s not actually dynamic.

It’s in the little moments, like the introduction of piano the moment you start running.

Or how a **slug enemy** will pop up and shoot its projectile in time with the music.
>鼻涕虫敌人 = slug enemy

Now just to poke a hole in my own argument, this is all under the assumption that the track starts at the beginning of the level.

And it does, but when you die, and you will die, a lot, the music continues to play, looping and throwing the entire thing out of sync.
>失去同步 = out of sync(synchronize)(协调, 同步)

I find this odd, as it’s so clear the music is meant to be played **in time** with the level.
>同时 = in time

I’m sure Moon Studios tested it out and realized it doesn’t work when you reset the music every time you die, but to me it just seems like a missed opportunity to make sure that every player experiences the level **the way it was intended**.
>就像设想的道路一样 = the way it was intended

Because the more I played this level in time with the music, the more I recognised its **cadence** and flow and how **intentional** every moment is.
>节奏 = cadence

>故意的 = intentional

So much so that I started to join in, playing it almost like it was a rhythm game.

I was releasing my bashes in time with the music and I discovered the best times to jump were actually on the beat.

It feels like **a choreographed dance**, with every enemy action, every movement Ori makes one part of something greater.
>精心编排的舞蹈 = a choreographed dance

This is what I mean by flow - where everything feels connected and works in relation to one another.

It’s not just how the controls flow – a jump connecting a bash, or whatever - it’s how the design elements of the game all interact to **form something cohesive**.
>形成统一的整体 = form something cohesive

When the music is coupled with level design, it can achieve so much more.

It can score moments of action, it can make the gameplay feel more rewarding, and it can even guide the  player, using our **inherent sense of rhythm** to let us know the best time to make that jump.
>内部的节奏感 = inherent sense of rhythm

When I’m in control of Ori, I feel connected to the forest of Nibel, like I’m part of the rhythm of the world, just like how I imagine our little forest spirit friend does.

There is a **kinetic** attachment that can occur when music is considered alongside of a game, and I think that is what makes Ori and the Blind Forest so special.
>活跃的 = kinetic

Thank you for watching, and huge thanks to my patrons who support the show.

Top tier **backers** are the biggest fans, and also confirmed to be the loveliest people.
>支持者 = backer

It really means so much.
