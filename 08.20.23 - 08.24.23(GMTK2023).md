### [The Best Games from GMTK Game Jam 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxZ_LOlFnU&t=8s)
##### (00:00 - 03:42)

Earlier this month, I challenged 23,000 game designers to create a brand new game - in just 48 hours.

And, what's more - the game had to fit a very difficult theme...

That's right. Roles **reversed**.
>反转 = reversed

I wanted to see games that let us become a character that we don't normally get to play.

Like, instead of controlling the buff knight in **a suit of armour** - what happens if we get to play as the army of enemy skeletons, instead?
>一套装甲 = a suit of armour

As always, the community **rose to** the challenge.
>冲到...中去 = rose to...

They submitted over 6,800 games.

Making it, once again, the biggest jam in itch.io's history.

Sorry about the servers.
>服务器 = server 

I played through the top 100 rated games, and picked out my 20 absolute favourites.

These games are clever, creative, **inventive**, and **annoyingly** good for games made in a single weekend.
>有发明才能的 = inventive

>烦人的(但是在语境中是褒义) = annoyingly

As always, the results are in no particular order or ranking - and this year, I've **bundled them into groups** that show off different takes on the theme.
>弄成一捆一捆(把游戏进行分类) = bundled them into groups

Okay. So, a very popular take on the theme was to make a game with a hero character, who moves through the level by themselves.

And you've got to help or **hinder** them, by taking on a completely different role.
>阻碍 = hinder

Take, for instance, Princess Paladin.

Here, the titular princess is very much the main character  as she takes on waves of **demonic** bats and **slime-spitting** snakes.
>名义上的 = titular 

>恶魔一般的 = demonic

>吐粘液的 = slime-spitting

You, **on the other hand**, play as her **measly** minion **sidekick**.
>另一方面 = on the other hand

>患麻疹的 = measly

>伙伴 = sidekick

So you dash around the level to pick up weapons and **health potions**, which you can then **yeet** towards to the princess to help her out.
>血瓶 = health pot

>(网络用语)扔 = yeet

Which means you're basically playing as Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite.

But it's surprisingly fun to play in the support role.

For one, while it can be tricky to work **alongside** an **autonomous** AI, these cute thought bubbles help make the princess's **decision-making** more **transparent**.
>在旁边 = alongside

>自治的 = autonomous

>决策 = decision-making

>透明 = transparent

And there's some clever design here as you **juggle your own needs** with those of the so-called hero.
>兼顾你自己的需求 = juggle your own needs

>所谓的 = so-called

When you pick up a health potion, for instance - you have to ask yourself: who needs this more?

You or me?

**Another take on this idea can be seen in** LedgePainter.
>这个想法还可以在...中看到

You're a game **dev** making a fancy **3D shooter** but - **alas** - your **playtesters** can't seem to navigate the level without some assistance.
>dev is for *developer*

>3D射击游戏 = 3D shooter

>唉(叹气) = alas

>游戏测试员 = playtester

So, it's time to do what all **triple A games** do and **paint the way forward** with bright yellow **splotches**.
>3A游戏 = triple A games

>描绘道路(向前) = paint the way forward

>斑点 = splotches

The game's **split into two halves**: you've got the editor where you lay down your paint, **from a limited supply**.
>halves是half的复数

>裂成两半 = split into the halves

>库存有限 = from a limited supply

And then you can hit play to see how the AI-controlled character **handles** your stage.
>处理 = handle = tackle(synonym)

You can also look at The Tutorial, which is also about painting a level **layout** to **give commands** to an autonomous hero.
>布局,设置 = layout

>下达指令 = give commands

So those are games where you help the AI-driven character reach their goal.

But plenty of games went the other way, and instead **pitted you against the protagonist**.
>让你和主人公作对 = pit you against protagonist

Bready or Not is clearly inspired by the **breakout hit** Vampire Survivors.
>突破性的一个东西(这里指代游戏) = breakout hit

But instead of playing as the **whip-wielding** hero, you're now commanding the army of enemies.
>挥舞鞭子的 = whip-wielding

Each one is on a different **cooldown timer**, so you need to bounce between the different birds to create a **varied** team.
>冷却时间 = cooldown time

>多样的 = varied

When you do enough damage, you can pick from a random selection of upgrades - from faster cooldowns, to **twice-as-many spawns**.
>双倍生成数量 = twice as many spawns

Now I have to admit, the similar entry, Vampire: No Survivors, is probably a little bit smarter as you must carefully spend a limited pool of resources to build the most effective army of enemies.

But I **slightly** preferred playing Bready or Not - probably because there's something **wickedly fun** about spawning such a massive pool of pigeons that it **literally** breaks the game's audio system.
>轻微地 = slightly

>恶趣味 = wickedly fun

>真实的,字面的 = literally
