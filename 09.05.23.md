### [How Going Underwater Changed Game Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11PA8QlyRNI)
(04:43 - end)

David Wise’s inspiration for his soundtrack to Donkey Kong Country came not from other games, but the **synthetic** film scores and pop music of the 80’s.
>合成的 = synthetic

Rather than scoring character movement in Aquatic Ambience, David Wise immersed the player in the marine environment of Cora Capers, and this changed everything about the composition.

Instead of a waltz rhythm, Aquatic Ambience **disorients** you by barely having a beat at all, giving you nothing **tangible** to grab hold of in the song, no solid ground to stand on.
>使迷失 = disorient(确定方向 = orient)

>有形的 = tangible

It used modern production techniques such as applying **filters** to **dampen the sound of the instruments**, and a delay to highlight the great expanse of the ocean.
>滤波器 = filter

>弄湿乐器的声音 = dampen the sound of the instruments

And its **instrumentation is sparse** – there’s a beautiful melody line, but it kind of blends in with the **layer of synthy pads** underneath it.
>乐器编排很简洁 = instrumentation is sparse(稀疏的)

>一层合成器 - layer of synthy pads

This was unusual for the time: game music almost always **put melody in the spotlight**, but in Aquatic Ambience it’s almost like David Wise tried to hide the melody.
>重点突出旋律(把旋律放在聚光灯下) = put melody in the spotlight

The trend for game and film score in the 21st century has been less melodic, more ambient.

Music that doesn’t draw attention to itself, but aims to immerse you in the world with **as little distraction as possible**.
>尽可能小的分心 = as little distraction as possible

Donkey Kong Country, and in particular Aquatic Ambience, preceded this in games by at least a decade, acting as a **paradigm** for the new wave of game music.
>范例 = paradigm

And in my opinion, it does it better than most because it still has that **catchy melody**.
>抓耳的旋律 = catchy melody(catchy earworms)

Aquatic Ambience even **charmed** the man himself, Koji Kondo, who **strayed from** the waltz style in Mario’s next underwater outing.
>使人喜悦 = charm

>背离... = stray from

Dire, Dire Docks is **sparse**, it uses those familiar **reverb-drenched synths**, and it also doesn’t have any **percussion** – at least, while you’re swimming.
>简洁的 = sparse

>充满混响的合成器 = reverb-drenched(湿透的, 充满的) synths

>打击乐器 = percussion

When you reach solid ground in this **cavern** though, drums are layered in on top to bring stability to the piece.
>洞穴 = cavern

This was the start of another method for scoring underwater – the dynamic approach.

A famous example is Banjo Kazooie, in which every level has its own underwater arrangement that seamlessly fades in whenever you duck-dive under the surface.

Unfortunately we didn’t see too much of this before the transition to CD-quality audio made it much more difficult to do, but the technology is catching up and we’re seeing it more and more.

Even the new Donkey Kong Country game did it, **so we’ve come full-circle again!**

>所以我们回到了起点! = so we've come full-circle again!

Water areas certainly aren’t the only times when dynamic music is used, but they have definitely encouraged creative use of music in games.

Looking back at the evolution of underwater music allows us to see the **often overlooked impact** it’s had.
>常常被忽略的影响 = often overlooked impact

From first legitimising video game music and placing it within the context of music history, to **paving the way for** more experimental and ambient pieces, and encouraging unique and creative uses of dynamic music that can only ever be found in games.
>为...铺设道路 = paving the way for

Water has consistently pushed the boundaries of game music, and the best part is, we get to **reap** the benefits of it, with some of the greatest music ever written for games.
>收获, 获得 = reap(重复让他**获得**了坏名声)

Hey, thanks for watching!

I’d like to thank my patrons for making this video possible.

I asked them for some suggestions of underwater music I could use in this video, and they certainly delivered.

Special thanks goes out to my top-level supporters.

I am incredibly grateful.
