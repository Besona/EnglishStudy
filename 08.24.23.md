### [How the song "Undertale" Hits Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xR-xOkKP44&t=112s)
(begin - 06:04)

This **long elevator ride** marks the beginning of Undertale’s final act New Home, and it faces quite a challenge.
>长长的电梯 = long elevator ride

How do you take this **absurd**, fanciful game, **turn it on its head** and **tip out some genuine human emotion**?
>怪异的 = absurd

>颠倒过来 = turn ... on its head

>找到(点到)真实人类的情感 = tip out some genuine human emotion

The answer, surprisingly, is with an **acoustic guitar**.
>木吉他 = acoustic guitar

Undertale certainly has a reputation that precedes itself.
>UT显然有着高于本身的声誉(整句翻译)

**As a love letter to** JRPGs of the 80s and early 90s, **it borrows from the era in its own game mechanics, story elements and music inspiration**.
>作为一封给...的情书 = as a love letter to

>他从那个时代借鉴了游戏机制, 故事元素, 和音乐灵感 = it borrows from the era in its game mechanics, story elements, nad music inspirations.


But it also works as **a piece of satire**, with every design choice made to **subvert the genre’s tropes**, **in particular**, combat.
>一种讽刺 = a piece of satire

>颠覆这种类别的原型 = subvert the genre's tropes

>特别地 = in particular

Undertale suggests that maybe violence shouldn’t be the **default means of conflict resolution**.
>解决争端的默认选项 = default means of conflict resolution

You **are encouraged to** talk with your **so-called** “enemies”, **peacefully defusing situations** by understanding the monster’s motives and desires, and the game **reinforces your decision** by rewarding you with a humorous battle.
>鼓励做某事 = be encouraged to do sth.

>所谓的(出现过) = so-called

>平和地解决 = peacefully defusing situations

>强化你的选择(也可以理解成鼓励你的选择) = reinforce your decision

The core idea behind Undertale’s design and story is that of **empathy** : sharing in the emotions of others.
>共鸣 = empathy

Now if I was being **pedantic** **I’d argue that** **the combat more evokes sympathy**, understanding of others’ emotions.
>学究式的, 卖弄学识的 = pedantic

>我认为... = I'd argue that...

>战斗唤起了同情 = the combat evokes sympathy

But how Undertale really **hits you with true empathy** is through its music, **specifically with** that acoustic guitar.
>用纯粹的同情直击你的心底 = hit you with true empathy

>尤其是 = specifically with

The track is called “Undertale” , and it’s a worthy song to **bear the game’s title**.
>承担起游戏的标题 = bear the game's title

Not only because it plays as the monsters of the Underground tell us **their side of the story**.
>他们那一边的故事 = their side of the story

But it’s also **the complete realisation of the game’s themes**, **both musically and narratively**.
>对游戏主题的完全揭露 = the complete realisation of the game's theme

>无论是音乐上,还是叙事上 = both musically and narratively(但好像这个是错用, narrative就够用了)

First, the musical themes.

**You can’t talk about Undertale’s soundtrack without mentioning leitmotif**: that’s when a single tune is used repeatedly throughout a piece to represent a character or idea.
>你不能抛开"乐旨"这个概念来聊UT = you can't talk about Undertale without mentioning leitmotif

Undertale’s soundtrack **is riddled with** leitmotif – out of 101 tracks there are only 12 that don’t have a **trace** of any other music used in the game.
>充斥着 = be riddled with

>回溯 = trace

And most of these are either just short **jingles** or **ambient tracks**.
>叮当小调 = jingles

>环境音 = ambient track

There’s a great **write-up** by Jason Yu detailing the game’s use of leitmotif, it’s definitely worth checking out.
>评论 = write-up

The song “Undertale” itself contains two different **motifs**.
>动机 = motif

The first is called His Theme and it’s played by the acoustic guitar.

Up until this point His Theme has really only been hinted at, but it takes full form in “Undertale” as this is when we learn about who He is: He’s Asriel, the monster prince whose actions caused the events of the game, which in turn led to the King Asgore wanting you dead.
>到目前为止，His Theme实际上只是被暗示过，但它Undertal中得到了完整的体现，因为这是当我们了解他是谁的时候：他是Asriel，怪物王子，他的行为导致了游戏的事件，这反过来又导致Asgore国王想要你死。

It’s not until repeated play-throughs does Asriel begin to play a larger role, so this theme is deeply rooted within the game’s story.
>not until B，do A = 在B发生以后, 做A

>在这段旋律多次播放后, Asriel才开始扮演一个更大的角色, 所以这首主题深深根植于游戏的故事之中

The other theme in “Undertale” can be heard in the piano line and should be much more familiar to the player.

This is the main theme of the game, and Jason Yu suggests that it **elicits a sense of safety and comfort**, as it is used in places of shelter and rest such as the Hotel before the final area, and Toriel’s home at the beginning of the game.
>引出一种安全和温馨的感觉

The first time we hear this main theme is in the **opening prologue**, **in the form of** the track Once Upon a Time.
>序章 = opening prologue

>以...的形式 = in the form of

This fairy-tale beginning is an authentic 8-bit track, **completely within the sound capabilities of the NES**, and it’s also **highly reminiscent of** the opening track to the original Mother game.
>完全在NES的音效能力范围内

>和...非常相似 = highly reminiscent of...

So while the prologue is busy establishing the **narrative context** of the game, the music is also already working to establish Undertale’s context among games.
>叙事背景 = narrative context

This continues into the 16-bit era, with many tracks using instrument sounds **straight out of** Super Nintendo games such as Earthbound and Final Fantasy VI.
>直接来自 = straight out of

Even through the soundtrack alone it’s obvious that Undertale has a deep respect for these classic JRPGs, even if it does like to **poke fun** at them a little bit.
>开玩笑 = poke fun
