### [The Best Games from GMTK Game Jam 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYxZ_LOlFnU&t=8s)
(11:34 - end)

And then the final twist on the theme was to go completely meta.
>meta = Self-referential humor(in this scenario)

Let's start with Pause to Play, which makes the pause menu an active participant in the puzzles.

So pausing the game doesn't actually stop the action - but it does **flash up** some buttons which can be used as platforms to **get around**.
>弹出 = flash up

>绕过 = get around

Then, the **options sliders** can be used as lifts - but they change the settings as you go up and down.
>选项中的滑块 = options slider

You can zoom the camera, for instance, to turn your character into a **tiny speck**.
>微不足道的事物 = tiny speck

More ideas are explored as the levels go on.
>随着关卡进行, 更多想法等待被探索(整句翻译)

It's an inventive puzzle platformer with plenty of room to grow into a full game,  if the designer wishes.

**A tip of the hat** to The Adventures of Raddish Boy, which also uses pause as a game mechanic.
>致敬 = a tip of the hat

We also saw games that reversed the roles between player and designer.

In Making the Game, you start with a platformer that is far too easy: just a **brief stroll** from start to finish.
>简短地散步 = brief scroll(scroll其实是卷轴的意思)

So you have to choose the next **avenue** for the designer, from a list of three random choices.
>大道 = avenue(第五大道)

Each time you expand the game, it gets harder and harder, but you've got to complete the level to carry on.
>但您必须完成这个关卡以继续游戏

When the game gets so difficult that it's just **incredibly tedious to play**...**it's time to hit release**
>玩起来过于乏味 = incredibly tedious to play

>是时候发布了 = it's time to hit release

Maybe **a little dig at your humble host**? I dunno - but I still liked this game a lot.
>对低调制作人的小小挖苦 = a little dig at your humble host

We also saw games that reversed the roles so hard, that they actually incorporated the game jam into the game itself.

There was, of course, Video Editor's Toolkit which lets you play as me, editing this video right now.

AI MARK: "**A brief interlude for our sponsor**, please check them out".
>插播一则小广告 = A brief interlude for our sponsor

But I'm gonna give the win to Our Dearest Player, which **emulates the experience of being** a game jam judge, in this exact jam.
>模拟了成为...的体验 = emulate the experience of being...

You play through **a handful of** simple reversed-role games - including a surprisingly good Flappy Bird clone - before **handing out stars in different categories**.
>几个,几款 = a handful of

>根据不同类别打星 = handing out stars in different categories

There's even a broken **Web GL** page, which makes the whole thing super authentic.
>WebGL is for Web Graphics Library

And then finally...Streamer Screamer is a wonderful **fourth-wall-breaking meta comedy**.
>打破第四面墙的良作 = fourth-wall-breaking meta comedy

This game features a **jibbering** Twitch **streamer**, who is showing off some **low-rent** horror game with a **spooky villain**.
>踌躇不前的人 = jibber

>直播主 = streamer

>小成本的 = low-rent

>吓人的坏蛋 = spooky villain

But then... the **screen pans up** to reveal that you are actually playing as the villain.
>屏幕上移 = screen pans up

You're carrying an iPad showing the stream, meaning that you can **triangulate the location of the streamer** and **sneak up** behind them for a jump scare.
>三角定位直播主的位置 = triangulate the location of the streamer

>悄悄接近 = sneak up = stalk(synonym)

You don't want to make the game too scary though - you want to vary your approach to build tension - and raise viewer numbers.

Plus, you'll want to **hold back** to hear the streamer's **inane babbling about Disney World and dreams**.
>暂停 = hold back

>有关迪士尼和梦想的胡言乱语 = inane babbling about Disney World and dreams

This is a genuinely **galaxy-brained** game idea and needs to be explored further.
>非常的聪明的 = galaxy-brained

STREAMER: "Oh my god!!"

So, there we have it! By reversing roles, these clever game designers found fertile ground for brand new game ideas.
>所以，这就是我们的介绍！通过颠倒角色，这些聪明的游戏设计师找到了崭新游戏创意的肥沃土地。(整句翻译)

We helped and hindered AI-driven heroes.

We **turned classic game ideas on their heads**.
>倒转... = turn ... on their heads

We took on unfamiliar roles.

We saw surprising twists on familiar concepts.

And we went so meta that the fourth wall **shattered into a thousand pieces**.
>碎了一地 = shattered into thousand pieces

As always, I want to shout out some honourable mentions.

Firehose is a manic score-chasing arcade game where you play as a firefighter... who starts fires.

You can only move as far as your hose will allow - so you'll then need to hop into the firetruck and drive somewhere else.

The Contrarian Press sees you **make the judicious use of** **censor bars** to rewrite newspaper headlines, and make new stories.
>明智地使用 = make the judicious use of 

>审查栏 = censor bar

It's all **presented with** **arty cut-out collage images**.
>由...呈现 = present with

>有艺术感的剪贴画图像 = arty cut-out collage images

And Spared is a bowling game where you play as the pins.

You've got to dodge at the last minute to avoid being struck down, and different bowlers with special powers **are introduced** to mix things up.
>...被引入 = be introduced = be incorporated(synonym)

To be honest, I can easily recommend a dozen more.

So you can now head to itch.io and find the full list of games - and the public's rankings for all the **entries**.
>参赛作品 = entry

Have a look through the top 100 titles, **at the very least**.
>至少 = at the very least

Thank you so much to everyone who took part in the jam, or rated some games.

Thanks to all the mods on Discord, to everyone who made our awesome Team Finder app, and to Leaf over at Itch.io.

An extra huge thank you to my Patrons who fund GMTK Game Jam - and **mean we don't have to get corporate sponsors involved**.
>这意味着我们不必需要企业赞助商 = mean e don't have to get corporate sponsors involved

The jam will be back in 2024.

So subscribe to this channel to receive the date announcement next year.

AI MARK: "And that's a wrap for 2023. See you next year".
