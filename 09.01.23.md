### [How Toby Fox Composed the Music of UNDERTALE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPCBm59yFfI&t=144s)
(07:19 - end)

For the second half of the song the bass plays the same thing **plus an octave below**.
>加上一个低八度 = plus an octave below

Instead of making two separate tracks for this, I'm just going to edit with **automation**, and that should sound like this.
>自动化 = automation

Now for the rest of the instruments which are all from SGM, beginning with Piano1.

[Music]

Adding a delay effect.

For the strings i'm adding some attack so they fade in more.

I've cloned those strings and removed the attack, because these extra notes we want to add are sharp.

We're also **panning them left** meaning you'll hear them more in your left ear.
>把他们向左移 = panning them left

**Pizzicato strings**.
>拨弦乐 = pizzicato strings

And finally the, uh okay google how do you pronounce **glockenspiel**?
>钟琴 = glockenspiel

That's pronounced glockenspiel 

And finally the glockenspiel

I should mention now that i'm doing all of these by ear and that I may get some things wrong like a note or a setting.

But that's okay this is all just for fun.

[Music]

Okay just saying that **recreation** was so accurate it got me **demonetized**, anyway.
>重新制作 = recreation

>被限制盈利了(限流) = demonetized

Now for something more **atmospheric**.
>制造气氛的 = atmospheric

You may know this already but the song The Choice is actually another song from the OST.

[Music]

That's right it's the song Undertale but slowed down with pull stretch.

The world of sound design is truly fascinating.

When it comes to sound effects, he used everything from 8-bit sounds, to sound fonts.

All the way to an episode of Spongebob.

And a **Mcdonald's commercial**
>麦当劳广告 = Mcdonald's commercial

You sure can get a lot in these bags.
>你一定能从中受益良多(整句翻译)

Just goes to show that anything is **fair game** in sound design.
>猎物 = fair game

Speaking of fair game he even uses fl keys, yep the default **cheesiest** sounding piano in fl studio, don't believe me.
>最下等的 = cheesiest

[Music]

This man somehow made fl keys sound good, wow.

I guess the lesson here is you don't need anything fancy to make magic.

Take the time to learn the basics and get better, figure out the **ins and outs** of composing, mixing, even learning an instrument.
>来龙去脉 = ins and outs

Finding out what things like reverb, delay, EQ, due to sounds.

But i won't sit here and repeat Toby's own words.

**That's right long ago**, back in July of 2016, he made a twit longer giving out advice on how to get better at music.
>那是很久以前的事了 = that's right long ago

I feel like not many people know about it, but i think it's a really insightful read if you want to start making your own stuff.

Thanks for watching everyone.

I hope this was an insightful look into the **realm of game composition**.
>游戏配乐的领域 = realm of game composition

There's more I could have put in here, but i didn't want to make the video too long

I'll land it on a quote though.
>我会用一句引用来结束本视频 = I'll land it on a quote though.

"I'm sure in 10 years, some kid who played Undertale will create a game that surpasses it".

I look forward to playing that.

As for me I don't know if I'll make a game, but that sure does inspire me to get better at music.

For anyone who wants to **make that reality for themselves**, I hope this video helped you understand at least the musical side of things.
>实现这个愿望 = make that reality for themselves

And toby if you ever watch this, thank you for everything, good dog

[Music]

God I really hope someone else cares about this stuff .

I'm just that one guy who's like dude they use pad 8 from the Paper Mario sound font in Omori isn't that cool?
